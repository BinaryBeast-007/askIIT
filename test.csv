NORMS FOR BTECH PROGRAMME

[As approved by a) the BoG in its 18th meeting held on 16 May 2016 and 34th meeting held on 28 April
2022 b) Senate in its 61st meeting held on 15th November 2022, updated in the 63rd/64th

meetings of the Senate]

The curriculum of the undergraduate programme at IIT Gandhinagar focuses on students’
overall development and step-by-step value addition. The aim is to
§ impart a broad-based education
§ emphasize strong fundamentals and substantial interdisciplinary exposure
§ provide an opportunity to explore a wide spectrum of courses in each semester
§ provide sufficient design exposure
§ promote planning and organization, and encourage team work
§ sensitize students to their socio-cultural context
§ equip students for future leadership, transcending conventional disciplinary
barriers
§ emphasize need for lifelong learning and relearning.
The BTech programme is divided into two distinct but compatible parts called Institute level
curriculum and Discipline specific curriculum. Each student is required to go through the
Institute level curriculum, irrespective of his/her chosen branch of specialization. It consists of
a package of compulsory courses, besides a few elective courses. The Discipline specific
curriculum consists of a set of compulsory courses, electives, and project work.
All students admitted to the first year of undergraduate (BTech and BTech-MTech)
programmes are called at least one week before the rest of the batches. First, they go through
a Foundation Programme of about four weeks (five weeks for students admitted till AY 2022-
23) followed by regular semester activities of about twelve weeks.
A student is required to pass the prescribed minimum courses of the curriculum for his/her
programme and complete the minimum credits requirement of 169-175 for the BTech degree
according to the structure prescribed by each discipline.
A. BTech Curriculum (Applicable for students admitted from AY 2022-23)
1. Typically forty hours of study load (mind-space time) of a student may be counted as
equivalent to one credit i.e. in a four credit course, a study load of 160 hours is
expected from the student in a semester, including contact hours.
2. All BTech students are required to complete 28 credits of courses under the
Humanities and Social Sciences basket, including two mandatory Writing courses
namely HS 191: Introduction to Writing I (2 credits) and HS 192: Introduction to
Writing II (2 credits).
3. In addition to the Writing courses, the Humanities and Social Sciences courses which
are mandatory for undergraduate students are Economics (4 credits), Introduction to
Philosophy (4 credits) and World Civilizations and Cultures (4 credits). In the
future, baskets of courses may be offered as an alternative to the mandatory Humanities
and Social Sciences courses. Rest of the 12 credits will be covered through Humanities,
Social Sciences or Management electives, with 4 credits (2 courses of 2 credits each)
worth of courses from a General Education Basket. Some of the courses which could

Academic Affairs Advisory No. 13 (Aug 2023) Page No. 2
be considered under the General Education (GE) Basket include courses on Cultural
Expression, Performing Arts, Theatre, Fine Arts, Sports etc. The courses under the
mandatory General Education Basket (up to 4 credits) will have Pass/Fail grade and not
an usual letter grade. In cases where a student fails to clear the Foundation Programme,
they may clear an additional 4 credits worth of GE courses for graduation. Note: Credit
for courses offered under the General Education Basket cannot be counted towards the
graduation requirements for students who are admitted before 2022-23.
4. All students are required to complete 8 credits worth of courses from the Science
Basket, which will have courses from Chemistry, Cognitive Science, Earth Sciences
and Physics. The parent discipline of the student may specify one course out of the
two courses which a student is required to complete. The courses which are covered
under the Science basket will be updated from time to time. In addition, all students are
required to complete an additional 4 credits of Basic Science electives, which may
also include courses from the Science basket.
5. Three mathematics courses [MA 103: Calculus of Single Variable & Linear Algebra
(4 credits), MA 104: Ordinary Differential Equations (2 credits), MA 203: Numerical
Methods (2 credits)] will be mandatory for all undergraduate students. Further, a
student will be required to complete 2 credits worth of courses from the Mathematics
Basket, which may include courses on Calculus of Several Variables, Complex
Analysis, Integral Transform, Optimization Theory and Partial Differential Equations to
name a few. The course to be completed from the Mathematics basket may be specified
by the parent discipline of the student. All Mathematics courses are envisioned to be
offered in the active learning mode, with significant use of visual learning tools,
programming assignments etc.
6. To give students a research experience during their undergraduate programme, all
undergraduate students are required to complete a project course. The student will be
free to do this Open Project Course (4 credits) in the area/discipline of their choice,
any time after the first year of their undergraduate programme. The Institute will also
explore the possibility of creating open project courses on entrepreneurship under the
aegis of IIEC. This project course may also be offered at the IITGN Research Park, in
collaboration with industry partners.
7. In addition to the Open Project Course, students are free to register for project courses

within or outside their parent discipline. These project courses can be at Level 2 (XX-
299), Level 3 (XX-399) or Level 4 (XX-499) and up to 16 credits of such project

courses can be counted towards the graduation requirements.
8. Students will have the opportunity to do Open Electives worth 16 credits.

courses are shown in Annexure I.
12. In addition, a comprehensive viva voce is conducted every semester. It is a mandatory
pass/fail activity with grade P/F.
13. Two sample academic paths are given below for Institute level courses. Students are
free to choose their own path, in consultation with their faculty advisors.

Academic Affairs Advisory No. 13 (Aug 2023) Page No. 4
B. BTech Curriculum (Applicable for students admitted before AY 2022-23)
The distribution of credits as well as sample academic plans for students admitted
before 2022-23 are shown in Annexure II.
C. Additional Learning
There is a provision of Honours and Minors available to students as an add on to the
base level BTech degree. The students will initially take admission in BTech programme
and will generally register for the minimum requirements of this base level programme.
Besides registering for a number of elective courses as part of their programme
requirement, the students will also be permitted to register for additional courses and
collect some additional credits. Students will not be required to declare the type of
elective or additional learning at the time of registration or during the course. They will
keep collecting these credits by successfully completing different courses during their
four years of stay by following their own planned academic path and aspirations in mind.
At the time of graduation, the students will claim their basic degree of BTech, or BTech
with Honours, or BTech with Minor(s) or BTech with Honours and with Minor(s) based
on the collected credits. The requirements of Honours and Minors are given below.
(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2022-23)
1. A student can receive a BTech (Honours) degree if they complete a minimum of 20
additional credits of courses specified by the parent discipline, over and above the
requirements of the base programme. This should include at least one project course
in the area of the parent discipline, in addition to the open project course. Further, two
open electives from the base programme, if it qualifies, may be counted in the 20
additional credits which are needed for Honours.
2. A student can receive a Minor in another discipline/focus area, if they complete a
minimum of 20 additional credits of courses specified by that discipline/focus area
group, over and above the requirements of the base programme. Two open electives
from the base programme, if it qualifies, may be counted in the 20 additional credits
which are needed for a Minor.

Academic Affairs Advisory No. 13 (Aug 2023) Page No. 5

(Applicable for all other students)
1. Honours: In addition to the requirements of the base level BTech degree, the students
will complete 20 credits of courses which enhance their core competence in their
discipline. It is possible that a course, which is not generally offered by the same
discipline but helps the students deepen their understanding in the core discipline, may
also be considered for Honours with the approval of the DPC and the DOAA. For
Honours, the student will be required to complete 08 credits of BTech projects
related to the discipline. One of the open elective courses of base programme, if it
qualifies, may be counted towards Honours, in which case the requirement of open
electives will reduce to 12 credits.
2. Minor: In addition to the requirements of the base level BTech degree, the students will
complete 20 credits of courses from another discipline which enhance their core
competence in that discipline. It is possible that a course, which is not generally offered
by that particular discipline but helps the students deepen their core understanding in
that discipline, may also be considered for Minor with the approval of the DPC and
DOAA. One of the open elective courses of base programme, if it qualifies, may be
counted towards Minor, in which case the requirement of open electives will reduce to
12 credits.
D. Academic Load
§ A student will normally register for 20 - 24 credits in a semester as per the respective
programme. Each course carries a weightage in terms of credits depending upon the
study load on the student and/or the number of contact hours (lectures and tutorials)
and/or laboratory hours.
§ There is no limit on the total number of project courses which a student can register
during their programme. However, a maximum of 16 credits of project courses can
be counted towards graduation requirements, irrespective of whether the student
claims for BTech or BTech with Honours.
§ A student may register up to a maximum of 28 credits in a semester. However,
Faculty Advisor may specify a lower limit than 28 credits.
§ A student who is placed on Guided Progress Scheme (GPS) can register for a

§ A student with CPI of 7.0 or above may be recommended by the Faculty Advisor to take
an overload of one course (up to a maximum of 32 credits) subject to the approval of
Chairperson, SAPC. Any relaxation to the minimum CPI requirement for overload may
be considered by the Chairperson, SAPC based on the recommendation of DPC.
§ Similarly, Chairperson, SAPC may allow a student to take a reduced load. Also, a
deficient student may be required to take a reduced load as per the
provisions/recommendations of SAPEC/Faculty Advisor/SAPC/ decisions of the
Senate.

§ A student can register for one-credit short courses in addition to any of the above-
mentioned limits of academic load. These courses are not counted as overload. These

credits are not considered in graduation requirements; however, the successfully
completed courses with their titles will be mentioned in the transcripts.

2,NORMS FOR BTECH-MTECH DUAL DEGREEPROGRAMME,Academic Affairs,B-Tech,"NORMS FOR BTECH-MTECH DUAL DEGREEPROGRAMME
[As approved by a) The BoG in its 18th meeting held on 16th May2016 and 34th
meeting held on 28th April 2022 b) The Senate in its 60th meeting held

on 26th September 2022]

1. Introduction:
Students may be admitted to the BTech – MTech dual degree programme at IIT Gandhinagar in
the following manners:
● The Institute may directly admit students to the BTech-MTech dual degree programme
(hereafter referred to as the direct admission mode) based on the results of JEE (Advanced)
on recommendation of JoSAA. Initially, 20 students will be admitted each in Computer
Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering from the academic year 2022-23. In the
subsequent years, such students may be admitted to other disciplines as well.
● Students enrolled in the BTech programme at IIT Gandhinagar can opt to join BTech-MTech
dual degree programme (hereafter referred to as the sliding mode), provided they fulfill the
eligibility criteria and are recommended by their respective disciplines.
2. Eligibility and Selection Process (Sliding Mode):
● BTech students at IIT Gandhinagar who have joined in 2013 or later may apply for a dual
degree programme any time after completion of four semesters, but latest by the end
of six semesters. Students in 2013 batch may be permitted to opt for conversion to dual
degree by July 2016 as a one-time exception.
● The students should have secured a minimum CPI of 6.0 out of 10 at the time of application.
● The students are free to apply to disciplines (in which a regular MTech programme exists)
other than the discipline in which they are enrolled for their BTech programme, provided they
are eligible.
● The disciplines will announce the discipline wise eligibility criteria in advance.
● Recommendations for conversion to dual degree programme will be made by a selection
committee setup at the discipline in which the student wishes to pursue their MTech.
3. Change of Programme and/or Branch (Direct Admission Mode):
● Students admitted to the BTech-MTech dual degree programmes through direct admission
mode are eligible for a change of programme/branch. This one-time change will be at the
beginning of the second year and will be governed by the same branch change policies
followed for BTech programmes. For this purpose, the direct admission BTech-MTech dual
degree programmes will be considered equivalent to a branch of a regular BTech programme.
For example, a BTech-MTech Dual Degree in Computer Science and Engineering student

Academic Affairs Advisory 39(Version 2.0 October 2022) Page 2
could change the programme to BTech in Chemical Engineering, BTech in Computer Science
& Engineering, or BTech-MTech Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering. Similarly, a student
admitted to BTech in Chemical Engineering could change the programme to direct admission
BTech-MTech Dual Degree programmes in addition to options for change of branch among
the regular BTech disciplines.
● At the beginning of the second year, after a round of re-allotment of students following the
branch change policy mentioned above, students in a direct admission BTech-MTech dual
degree programme can request a change of programme within the discipline before the
beginning of the second year. This change can be permitted based on merit (similar to a
regular branch change), with the constraint that the number of students on roll in the direct
admission BTech-MTech dual degree programme does not fall below 50% of its sanctioned
strength. The merit at the end of the first year of the BTech programme will be considered for

this programme change (without fail grades/backlogs). Change of programme from BTech-
MTech dual degree to regular BTech programme can be effected only once at the beginning

of the second year.
4. Graduation Requirements and Norms:
● Students enrolled in the dual degree programme have to earn a minimum of 72 credits, in
addition to the credits counted towards their BTech degree requirements. This is against the
80 credits required for regular MTech programme after BTech or equivalent degree.
● Students should obtain a minimum of 24 credits through courses and a minimum of 32 credits
through MTech thesis units. Note that the regular MTech requires minimum 32 credits through
courses and 32 credits of thesis units.
● The open elective requirement in the BTech programme of the student may be reduced by 4
credits.
● The student in sliding mode may have to do additional courses if they opt for an MTech
degree in a discipline other than their BTech discipline, which will be specified by the second
discipline during the change of programme.
● The students have to also successfully defend their MTech thesis to complete the
requirements of the dual degree.
● Single CPI will be maintained till the completion of all the requirements of both the degrees
and two separate CPIs will be mentioned in the final transcript, based on the graduation claim
made by the student. One CPI will be for all the courses claimed towards the BTech degree
and another based on all credits earned towards the MTech degree.
● The students may also opt for Honours in the same discipline and/or Minor(s) in other
discipline(s) as part of their BTech degree by clearing the additional requisite credits.
● Pass/fail conversion will be allowed only for two courses during the entire period of the dual
degree.
● All other norms such as substitution of courses will be applicable separately for the courses
counted towards BTech and MTech degrees.

Academic Affairs Advisory 39(Version 2.0 October 2022) Page 3
● If the student does not maintain a CPI of above 6.0 or have secured more than two U grades
in MTech thesis units, the student will be converted to the BTech programme.
● The maximum duration of the dual degree programme will be seven years.
5. Fellowship:
● Fellowship, as per prevailing rates for MTech students, may be paid to students opting for
the dual degree program for a maximum period of 12 months.
● The fellowship will begin after the eighth semester, subject to the student completing all the
requirements of the BTech degree.
● Students having a CPI of 8.0 or above (7.5 for students from SC/ST/PD category) at the end
of the 8th semester are eligible for the fellowship without having to appear for GATE. All other
students will need a valid GATE score (above the prescribed cut-off) to avail fellowship.
6. Tuition Fees: The students will deposit the tuition fees as per norms of the BTech programme
until completion of the eighth semester or completion of requirements of their BTech degree,
whichever is later. They will pay fees as per norms of the MTech programme (for candidates paid
a fellowship) afterwards, till completion of all requirements for the award of both the Degrees.
7. Award of Degrees: The student will be awarded both BTech and MTech degrees after
successfully completing all the requirements for the award of both the degrees.
8. Exit Options:
a) Sliding Mode: The student may request to opt out of the dual degree programme at any
point during the programme after giving valid reasons, and if the request is approved, the
student will be treated as in the BTech programme.
b) Direct Admission Mode: The BSc in Engineering degree will be an exit option for students
who are admitted to the BTech-MTech dual degree programme through the direct admission
route. Exit with a BTech is not an option for students in this programme, who remain in the
BTech-MTech dual degree after the beginning of the second year."

(As approved by Board of Governors in its 9th Meeting held on 28th March 2013, updated in the 24th meeting of
the Senate held on 20th July 2016 , 29th meeting of the Senate held on 11th December 2017, 33rd meeting of the
Senate held on 22nd November 2018 and 64th meeting of the Senate held on 10 May 2023)

I. Background
The Humanities and Social Sciences(HSS) group at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar (IITGN) offers
students in the BTech Programme courses aimed at developing essential skills in critical thinking and writing along
with the knowledge of literature, society, politics, history, arts and philosophies of the mind and body. It also offers
a PhD programme in HSS disciplines that provides personalized and intensive scholarly mentoring to guide original
research. The HSS faculty team at IITGN, with its diverse expertise, is uniquely equipped to offer a multidisciplinary
Masters Programme with an exceptional potential to attract best students in the country.
II. Why Masters programme?
§ The Masters Programme extends the aims and goals of IITGN to provide a well-rounded, broad based and
excellent education for the benefit of a larger community interested in both arts and sciences.
§ The multidisciplinary profile of faculty at IITGN aims to provide a programme that interweaves approaches
from different disciplines and addresses the gap of interdisciplinary learning in higher education in India.
§ The Programme gives to IITGN faculty and students a platform to disseminate research ideas and also
establish a dialogue with academia/industry/policy makers for collaborative research.
§ Given the strength and skills available in the Humanities and Social Sciences Group at IITGN, the
Programme is in a position to be a leading one in the country.
§ The Programme would enable students to pursue a PhD in any of the disciplines s/he chooses to specialize
in, and also be equipped to partake of a range of employment opportunities (media, NGOs, consultancy,
communications industry).
§ We envision this to be a broad Humanities and Social Sciences programme that gives students exposure to
the many disciplines that fall under HSS along with interconnections between them. For instance, a student
is able to understand how Political Science is different from History, in that one looks at structures of
governance and power, while the other has a more temporal emphasis. Having said that, the two disciplines
work in tandem and at the end of the course the student should be able to see that, enabling him/her to make
an informed choice about his/her academic focus in the future.
III. What are the focus areas?
The HSS at IITGN recognizes that an interdisciplinary approach to the study of culture, society and politics, will
ensure intellectual flexibility and rigor in the use of theory and methodology. To establish that, the programme is
organized around the following indicative and overlapping themes:

§ Identity and difference
§ Knowledge systems
§ Systems of power
§ Negotiations between arts and ideology
§ History and memory
§ Development and exclusion
§ Global and local systems

Through the rigorous coursework and guided research project, it is expected that students in the programme will

Academic Affairs Advisory 29 (July 2023) Page 2
be able to develop conceptual tools to critically analyze structural inequalities relating to gender, sexuality, class,
caste, national identity and find ways to address them more effectively.
IV. Curriculum Structure and other features of the programme
(a) Highly competitive awards will be available to support students in attending conferences or to participate in
summer internships at well recognized organizations/institutes.
(b) A minimum of 80 credits will be needed to successfully complete the programme. This includes a minimum
56 credits of coursework, and minimum of 20 credits of research project. Masters students in this programme
will be required to take 6 out of 10 available Core courses and the remaining credits will be complemented
by a cluster of electives. Students who were admitted before AY 2023-24, are required to complete 4 to 6 core
courses as per the list shown for such students in Appendix 1. A hypothetical roadmap indicating the credit
structure and tentative courses has been appended (See Appendix 2).
(c) The Electives in this programme include at least two courses (8 credits) from disciplines other than HSS
(Engineering/Natural Sciences). The goal of this unique provision is to give students an exposure to the range
of disciplines covered by the IITGN faculty community.
(d) Elective courses include those that are either offered by the parent discipline or aligned disciplines in the
general area of the programme of study. In some cases appropriate undergraduate courses could also be
offered as electives for the MA programme. However, electives could also be taken from the entire pool of
postgraduate as well as undergraduate courses offered by any discipline in the institute. In keeping with the
Institute’s philosophy of emphasizing the interdisciplinary approach, students are required to take at least 8
credits of courses arising from Engineering/Natural Sciences disciplines besides FP 602 – Writing (4
credits).
(e) Students can also take up an Independent Study (eg. Project courses) with any IITGN faculty member and
earn credits towards it. A maximum of 12 credits out of Electives can be acquired through Independent Study
courses.
(f) Over the first two semesters, students are encouraged to start thinking about acquiring research experience
through single or multiple projects and interact with faculty members. Before registering for research project
credits, an adviser will be identified for each student. Students will be required to submit a research report for
assessment purposes to the concerned faculty/committee on the work performed during the semester. Based
on the report, the committee/concerned faculty will award a letter grade for each discrete unit (4 credits) of
research project work.
(g) Research Project - This correlates with approximately six courses. At least 20 credits of research project work
will be expected as a requirement for successful completion of the MA program.
(h) Part of credit fulfillment may take place through a student’s immersion in institutions other than IITGN. In such
cases, equivalent credit transfer will be considered.
(i) Summer research internships/projects on or off campus are required as part of the Master’s curriculum to
help students to complement their research activities, build networks/professional references and advance
their career aspirations.
(j) Completing PG Orientation Programme Aarohan (2 Credits) is a mandatory graduation requirement for all
MA students. [Note: The two credits for Aarohan is in addition to the minimum credit requirements of 80 credits
required for completing graduation requirements].
§ Aarohan is a two-week long programme that all the newly joined students are expected to
successfully complete before they commence the first semester in their academic programme. It would

Academic Affairs Advisory 29 (July 2023) Page 3
have 5 themes (Inventing and Discovering, Communication, Professionalism and Ethics, Social
Engagement, Well-being).
§ In cases where a student fails to clear Aarohan, they must clear an additional two credits worth of HSS
courses for graduation (applicable for all students who join from Semester – II, 2022-23 onwards).
(k) Students joining the MA programme (from semester – I, 2021-22 onwards) must complete two Physical
Education (PE) courses, one each in their first two semesters, as part of their graduation requirements.
These courses will be evaluated on a Pass/No Pass grade basis.
(l) The minimum eligibility criteria for applying to the Master’s programme is as follows: Bachelor’s degree in
any examination (e.g. BA/BSc (Hons), BTech, BE, etc.) with at least 55% marks in aggregate (5.5 CGPA for
students with letter grades/CGPA) for General/OBC category candidates and at least 50% aggregate marks
(5.0 CGPA for students with letter grades/CGPA) for SC, ST and PwD category candidates.
(m) The admission process will include a combination of review of application, an entrance examination and
interviews. However, the faculty will review the effectiveness of admission process to fine-tune it from time to
time.
V. Early Termination
(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2023-24)
§ Any student failing to earn a minimum of 28 credits within one year from his/her start of the first year
programme (either due to admission or due to restart) should start his/her programme afresh or exit the
programme. A student needs to secure a passing grade for earning the credits registered for the course.
§ If the programme is restarted, then the credits earned and semesters registered prior to restart will not be
carried over.
§ Restart will be permitted only once.
§ In case the CPI of a student falls below 6.0 out of 10, the fellowship provided, if any, by the Institute will be
stopped immediately and for the future.
§ There will be no maximum permissible duration to complete the requirements of the programme. However,
at any time, credits earned older than eight years will be deemed expired and will not count towards the
graduation requirements.
(Applicable for students admitted before AY 2023-24)
§ Any student failing to earn a minimum of 26 credits at the end of first two registered (active) semesters can
either apply to start his/her programme afresh or will have to exit the programme.
§ If the programme is restarted, then the credits earned and semesters registered prior to restart will not be
carried over.
§ If a student fails to earn 26 credits in the first two semesters but successfully completes 15 or more credits
in the second active semester, then only the first semester will be repeated, i.e., the student will be deemed
to have fresh start from the second active semester.
§ The restart will be permitted only once.

Academic Affairs Advisory 29 (July 2023) Page 4
§ Upon restart, the student must successfully complete a minimum of 12 credits at the end of first semester
and a minimum of 26 credits at the end of first two semesters, or else his/her admission will be terminated
and no further chance shall be given.
§ The maximum period allowed to complete the programme will be three years (the first year or first semester

Introduction
With the increasing dependency on electrical gadgets and digital facilities, and chemical usage, it is
imperative that all precautions are put in place for safe use of equipment hazardous materials and
chemicals and safety of users. IITGN the premier institute of Nation is fully equipped with its
modern labs, class rooms and other necessary facilities for use by students, staff and faculty. It
also implies that complexity of all electric systems and chemicals must be carefully studied and
used to avoid any accident. This document lay down certain aspects of handling of hazardous
chemicals, fire prevention and fire fighting in case required.
Fire Prevention
IITGN campus in spread over in approx 400 acres of land, out of which constructed area in its
present state is approx. 118 acres which includes Academic,Hostel and Housing blocks. The
buildings are compact from functional view point at the same time area is sufficiently open to
prevent fire from spreading.
Best way to prevent fire is to understand the probable causes of fire and take adequate
precautions to prevent fire.
Probable Causes of Fire
 Electrical
o Over loading of wires and at power sockets.
o Mishandling of electrical equipment and machinery.
o Loose connection in multi outlets plugs.
o Electrical Heater.
o Loose wiring.
o Improper Insulation at junction points.
o Improper connection with extension cords
 Human Error
o Storage of waste and combustible material near probable source of fire.
o Mishandling of Electrical appliances and machines.
o Mishandling of flammable chemicals and solvents
o Unattended Hot Plate.
o Poor housekeeping.
o Throwing away lighted cigarettes.
 Lab Accidents
o Heating of oxidizing materials by gas flame or oil bath.
o Use of water reactive material in presence of water.
o Exposure to air of pyrophoric materials.
o Storage of Incompatible chemicals.
o Inadequate Ventilation while experimenting with gases.
o Mixing of wrong chemical solutions while doing experiments in lab.
o Storage of gas cylinder in confined space/poor ventilation.
o Un-controlled heat produced by chemical reaction.

o Bunsen burners can pose fire hazards.
o Improper grounding of equipment and machinery.
o Ignorance of MSDS (Material safety data sheet), instructions on safety.
 Natural Calamity: Lightening etc.
Preventive Measures
 General
o Watch against any loose electric connections, short circuiting, sparks from fuse/sockets
etc. and report immediately to concerned staff.
o Ensure all lights are switched off & plugs are pulled out while leaving the room / lab by end
of the day.
o Unattended burning is strictly prohibited.
o Wear lab coats,safety glasses and shoes before enteringlabs with chemicals and heavy
machinery.
o Wear gloves while handling chemicals and corrosive materials.
o Read safety descriptions (MSDS) about the chemicals and solvents thoroughly before
opening the containers.
o Open and handle all chemicals only inside fume hoods.
o Observe fire precautions in cafeteria, canteen &kitchen.
o Maintain clean and clutter free campus.
o Ensure regular inspection and testing of all electrical appliances and wiring.
o Do not leave flame unattained.
o Follow “no smoking” rules in applicable areas.
o Ensure proper ventilation and illumination.
o Be aware of all entry / exit doors to be fire resistant.
o Follow all norms as laid down by local fire office.
o Display important contact details / tele nos in each block at suitable location.

Action to be Taken in Case of Outbreak of Fire
Famous saying “Man proposes and God disposes” cannot be ignored. If at all unfortunate accident
takes place, IITGN community must be well prepared to stop the fire immediately. For this, each
person must be aware of the actions to be taken as part of collective effort. Awareness capsules,
training and regular practice will contribute immensely towards preventing / stopping fire outbreak.
People
It is important to identify the response force expected to be involved in firefighting and need to be
trained accordingly. These can be classified as under:

First Responders – Security and house- keeping staff along with the researcher who works in the
lab regularly in near vicinity are expected to react first and need to be trained on actions to be
taken and use of firefighting equipment.
Actions by First Responders–The expected sequence of action would be as under:
 Moment fire is noticed; draw attention of all persons around by shouting “FIRE, FIRE, FIRE”.
 Whistle to be blown by security staff onshort spurts to draw attention of persons in near
vicinity.
 By this time the fire alarm system (hotter etc)will get activated and location of fire will be
indicated. It is possible that first indication of fire comes from alarm system before anybody
comes to know.
 Security staff or persons from support team (in case security staff is not available at site at
that moment) to immediately take out fire extinguisher from nearest location and try to
extinguish fire.
 In case of electrical fire, immediately switch off the power from nearest mains and use CO2
extinguisher only and not to spray water.
Support Team – All staff and faculty are expected to support firefighting efforts.
Following actions are expected to be taken:
 Faculty/students/staff present near the area of fire must (MUST) maintain calm, evacuate
persons/belongings etc in case stuck inside and ensure there is no stampede like situation.
 Call Gandhinagar fire station and call fire tender, if required.
 Switch off main switch of the affected room / block as applicable in case of electric fire.
 Evacuate persons who may need medical attention on priority.
 Help entry of firefighting staff and fire tender movement up to location of fire.
 Help in de-crowding the area and guide them to pre assigned area, if required.
 Inform police in case situation demand for crowd management.
Training
Training is the most important part of firefighting operation. In case the responder is not trained to
operate the firefighting equipment, he can’t be named as responder. Training can be classified as
under:
(a) Training to handle the equipment (awareness Capsule)
(b) Mock up drills to remain abreast with the training.
(c) Handling of chemicals and lab safety.
Awareness Capsule: Capsule should be conducted atleast once in four months so that all the
security and housekeeping staff undergo this training at least once a year. Capsule should include
following topics:
(a) Likely cause of fire
(b) Preventive measures
