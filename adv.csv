[As approved by a) the BoG in its 18th meeting held on 16 May 2016 and 34th meeting held on 28 April
2022 b) Senate in its 61st meeting held on 15th November 2022, updated in the 63rd/64th

meetings of the Senate]

The curriculum of the undergraduate programme at IIT Gandhinagar focuses on students’
overall development and step-by-step value addition. The aim is to
§ impart a broad-based education
§ emphasize strong fundamentals and substantial interdisciplinary exposure
§ provide an opportunity to explore a wide spectrum of courses in each semester
§ provide sufficient design exposure
§ promote planning and organization, and encourage team work
§ sensitize students to their socio-cultural context
§ equip students for future leadership, transcending conventional disciplinary
barriers
§ emphasize need for lifelong learning and relearning.
The BTech programme is divided into two distinct but compatible parts called Institute level
curriculum and Discipline specific curriculum. Each student is required to go through the
Institute level curriculum, irrespective of his/her chosen branch of specialization. It consists of
a package of compulsory courses, besides a few elective courses. The Discipline specific
curriculum consists of a set of compulsory courses, electives, and project work.
All students admitted to the first year of undergraduate (BTech and BTech-MTech)
programmes are called at least one week before the rest of the batches. First, they go through
a Foundation Programme of about four weeks (five weeks for students admitted till AY 2022-
23) followed by regular semester activities of about twelve weeks.
A student is required to pass the prescribed minimum courses of the curriculum for his/her
programme and complete the minimum credits requirement of 169-175 for the BTech degree
according to the structure prescribed by each discipline.
A. BTech Curriculum (Applicable for students admitted from AY 2022-23)
1. Typically forty hours of study load (mind-space time) of a student may be counted as
equivalent to one credit i.e. in a four credit course, a study load of 160 hours is
expected from the student in a semester, including contact hours.
2. All BTech students are required to complete 28 credits of courses under the
Humanities and Social Sciences basket, including two mandatory Writing courses
namely HS 191: Introduction to Writing I (2 credits) and HS 192: Introduction to
Writing II (2 credits).
3. In addition to the Writing courses, the Humanities and Social Sciences courses which
are mandatory for undergraduate students are Economics (4 credits), Introduction to
Philosophy (4 credits) and World Civilizations and Cultures (4 credits). In the
future, baskets of courses may be offered as an alternative to the mandatory Humanities
and Social Sciences courses. Rest of the 12 credits will be covered through Humanities,
Social Sciences or Management electives, with 4 credits (2 courses of 2 credits each)
worth of courses from a General Education Basket. Some of the courses which could

Academic Affairs Advisory No. 13 (Oct 2023) Page No. 2
be considered under the General Education (GE) Basket include courses on Cultural
Expression, Performing Arts, Theatre, Fine Arts, Sports etc. The courses under the
mandatory General Education Basket (up to 4 credits) will have Pass/Fail grade and not
an usual letter grade. In cases where a student fails to clear the Foundation Programme,
they may clear an additional 4 credits worth of GE courses for graduation. Note: Credit
for courses offered under the General Education Basket cannot be counted towards the
graduation requirements for students who are admitted before 2022-23.
4. All students are required to complete 8 credits worth of courses from the Science
Basket, which will have courses from Chemistry, Cognitive Science, Earth Sciences
and Physics. The parent discipline of the student may specify one course out of the
two courses which a student is required to complete. The courses which are covered
under the Science basket will be updated from time to time. In addition, all students are
required to complete an additional 4 credits of Basic Science electives, which may
also include courses from the Science basket.
5. Three mathematics courses [MA 103: Calculus of Single Variable & Linear Algebra
(4 credits), MA 104: Ordinary Differential Equations (2 credits), MA 203: Numerical
Methods (2 credits)] will be mandatory for all undergraduate students. Further, a
student will be required to complete 2 credits worth of courses from the Mathematics
Basket, which may include courses on Calculus of Several Variables, Complex
Analysis, Integral Transform, Optimization Theory and Partial Differential Equations to
name a few. The course to be completed from the Mathematics basket may be specified
by the parent discipline of the student. All Mathematics courses are envisioned to be
offered in the active learning mode, with significant use of visual learning tools,
programming assignments etc.
6. To give students a research experience during their undergraduate programme, all
undergraduate students are required to complete a project course. The student will be
free to do this Open Project Course (4 credits) in the area/discipline of their choice,
any time after the first year of their undergraduate programme. The Institute will also
explore the possibility of creating open project courses on entrepreneurship under the
aegis of IIEC. This project course may also be offered at the IITGN Research Park, in
collaboration with industry partners.
7. In addition to the Open Project Course, students are free to register for project courses

within or outside their parent discipline. These project courses can be at Level 2 (XX-
299), Level 3 (XX-399) or Level 4 (XX-499) and up to 16 credits of such project

courses can be counted towards the graduation requirements.
8. Students will have the opportunity to do Open Electives worth 16 credits.
9. Four semesters of Physical Education (0 credit) courses will be mandatory for all
undergraduate students.
10. Other mandatory Institute level courses include
a) ES 101: Engineering Graphics (3 credits)
b) ES 112: Computing (3 credits)
c) ES 113: Data Centric Computing (3 credits)
d) ES 114: Probability, Statistics and Data Visualization (3 credits)

11. Discipline specific courses will be for 62-64 credits. The details of discipline specific
courses are shown in Annexure I.
12. In addition, a comprehensive viva voce is conducted every semester. It is a mandatory
pass/fail activity with grade P/F.
13. Two sample academic paths are given below for Institute level courses. Students are
free to choose their own path, in consultation with their faculty advisors.B. BTech Curriculum (Applicable for students admitted before AY 2022-23)
The distribution of credits as well as sample academic plans for students admitted
before 2022-23 are shown in Annexure II.
C. Additional Learning
There is a provision of Honours and Minors available to students as an add on to the
base level BTech degree. The students will initially take admission in BTech programme
and will generally register for the minimum requirements of this base level programme.
Besides registering for a number of elective courses as part of their programme
requirement, the students will also be permitted to register for additional courses and
collect some additional credits. Students will not be required to declare the type of
elective or additional learning at the time of registration or during the course. They will
keep collecting these credits by successfully completing different courses during their
four years of stay by following their own planned academic path and aspirations in mind.
At the time of graduation, the students will claim their basic degree of BTech, or BTech
with Honours, or BTech with Minor(s) or BTech with Honours and with Minor(s) based
on the collected credits. The requirements of Honours and Minors are given below.
(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2022-23)
1. A student can receive a BTech (Honours) degree if they complete a minimum of 20
additional credits of courses specified by the parent discipline, over and above the
requirements of the base programme. This should include at least one project course
in the area of the parent discipline, in addition to the open project course. Further, two
open electives from the base programme, if it qualifies, may be counted in the 20
additional credits which are needed for Honours.
2. A student can receive a Minor in another discipline/focus area, if they complete a
minimum of 20 additional credits of courses specified by that discipline/focus area
group, over and above the requirements of the base programme. Two open electives
from the base programme, if it qualifies, may be counted in the 20 additional credits
which are needed for a Minor. Please refer to the advisory on Minors for more details

Academic Affairs Advisory No. 13 (Oct 2023) Page No. 5
about minors, including currently available minors and list of courses specified by
disciplines (if any).
(Applicable for all other students)
1. Honours: In addition to the requirements of the base level BTech degree, the students
will complete 20 credits of courses which enhance their core competence in their
discipline. It is possible that a course, which is not generally offered by the same
discipline but helps the students deepen their understanding in the core discipline, may
also be considered for Honours with the approval of the DPC and the DOAA. For
Honours, the student will be required to complete 08 credits of BTech projects
related to the discipline. One of the open elective courses of base programme, if it
qualifies, may be counted towards Honours, in which case the requirement of open
electives will reduce to 12 credits.
2. Minor: In addition to the requirements of the base level BTech degree, the students will
complete 20 credits of courses from another discipline which enhance their core
competence in that discipline. It is possible that a course, which is not generally offered
by that particular discipline but helps the students deepen their core understanding in
that discipline, may also be considered for Minor with the approval of the DPC and
DOAA. One of the open elective courses of base programme, if it qualifies, may be
counted towards Minor, in which case the requirement of open electives will reduce to
12 credits.
D. Academic Load
§ A student will normally register for 20 - 24 credits in a semester as per the respective
programme. Each course carries a weightage in terms of credits depending upon the
study load on the student and/or the number of contact hours (lectures and tutorials)
and/or laboratory hours.
§ There is no limit on the total number of project courses which a student can register
during their programme. However, a maximum of 16 credits of project courses can
be counted towards graduation requirements, irrespective of whether the student
claims for BTech or BTech with Honours.
§ A student may register up to a maximum of 28 credits in a semester. However,
Faculty Advisor may specify a lower limit than 28 credits.
§ A student who is placed on Guided Progress Scheme (GPS) can register for a
maximum of 21 credits. For detailed norms about GPS scheme, please refer
Academic Affairs Advisory on IWS.
§ A student with CPI of 7.0 or above may be recommended by the Faculty Advisor to take
an overload of one course (up to a maximum of 32 credits) subject to the approval of
Chair, SAPC. Any relaxation to the minimum CPI requirement for overload may be
considered by the Chair, SAPC based on the recommendation of DPC.
§ Similarly, Chair, SAPC may allow a student to take a reduced load. Also, a deficient
student may be required to take a reduced load as per the provisions/recommendations
of SAPEC/Faculty Advisor/SAPC/ decisions of the Senate.

§ A student can register for one-credit short courses in addition to any of the above-
mentioned limits of academic load. These courses are not counted as overload. These

credits are not considered in graduation requirements; however, the successfully
completed courses with their titles will be mentioned in the proficiency transcripts.

Academic Affairs Advisory No. 13 (Oct 2023) Page No. 6

§ A student is required to seek approval for academic overload/underload.
§ No student is allowed to register for more than 10 credits during the summer term.

E. Early Termination
(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2023-24)
§ Any student failing to earn a minimum of 30 credits within one year from his/her start
of the first year programme (either due to admission or due to restart) should start
his/her programme afresh or exit the programme. A student needs to secure a
passing grade for earning the credits registered for the course.

F. Duration of the Programme
(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2023-24)
§ For all programmes, there will be no maximum permissible duration to complete the
requirements of the programme. However, at any time, credits earned older than eight
years will be deemed expired and will not count towards the graduation requirements.
§ After X years + 3 semesters, a request from the student is needed to extend the
programme on a semester by semester basis, where X is the nominal period for a given
programme (4 years for BTech/BSc and 5 years for BTech-MTech).
§ This is applicable for students admitted from AY 2023-24. However, students from
previous batches may opt for being considered under the above norms for duration of
the programme.
(Applicable for students admitted before AY 2023-24)
§ For the BTech programme, the maximum duration permitted, within which the
programme must be completed, is 12 semesters. If a student desires to finish his/her

2,NORMS FOR BTECH-MTECH DUAL DEGREEPROGRAMME,Academic Affairs,BTech,"INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY GANDHINAGAR
NORMS FOR BTECH-MTECH DUAL DEGREEPROGRAMME
[As approved by a) The BoG in its 18th meeting held on 16th May2016 and 34th
meeting held on 28th April 2022 b) The Senate in its 60th meeting held

on 26th September 2022]

1. Introduction:
Students may be admitted to the BTech – MTech dual degree programme at IIT Gandhinagar in
the following manners:
● The Institute may directly admit students to the BTech-MTech dual degree programme
(hereafter referred to as the direct admission mode) based on the results of JEE (Advanced)
on recommendation of JoSAA. Initially, 20 students will be admitted each in Computer
Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering from the academic year 2022-23. In the
subsequent years, such students may be admitted to other disciplines as well.
● Students enrolled in the BTech programme at IIT Gandhinagar can opt to join BTech-MTech
dual degree programme (hereafter referred to as the sliding mode), provided they fulfill the
eligibility criteria and are recommended by their respective disciplines.
2. Eligibility and Selection Process (Sliding Mode):
● BTech students at IIT Gandhinagar who have joined in 2013 or later may apply for a dual
degree programme any time after completion of four semesters, but latest by the end
of six semesters. Students in 2013 batch may be permitted to opt for conversion to dual
degree by July 2016 as a one-time exception.
● The students should have secured a minimum CPI of 6.0 out of 10 at the time of application.
● The students are free to apply to disciplines (in which a regular MTech programme exists)
other than the discipline in which they are enrolled for their BTech programme, provided they
are eligible.
● The disciplines will announce the discipline wise eligibility criteria in advance.
● Recommendations for conversion to dual degree programme will be made by a selection
committee setup at the discipline in which the student wishes to pursue their MTech.
3. Change of Programme and/or Branch (Direct Admission Mode):
● Students admitted to the BTech-MTech dual degree programmes through direct admission
mode are eligible for a change of programme/branch. This one-time change will be at the
beginning of the second year and will be governed by the same branch change policies
followed for BTech programmes. For this purpose, the direct admission BTech-MTech dual
degree programmes will be considered equivalent to a branch of a regular BTech programme.
For example, a BTech-MTech Dual Degree in Computer Science and Engineering student

Academic Affairs Advisory 39(Version 2.0 October 2022) Page 2
could change the programme to BTech in Chemical Engineering, BTech in Computer Science
& Engineering, or BTech-MTech Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering. Similarly, a student
admitted to BTech in Chemical Engineering could change the programme to direct admission
BTech-MTech Dual Degree programmes in addition to options for change of branch among
the regular BTech disciplines.
● At the beginning of the second year, after a round of re-allotment of students following the
branch change policy mentioned above, students in a direct admission BTech-MTech dual
degree programme can request a change of programme within the discipline before the
beginning of the second year. This change can be permitted based on merit (similar to a
regular branch change), with the constraint that the number of students on roll in the direct
admission BTech-MTech dual degree programme does not fall below 50% of its sanctioned
strength. The merit at the end of the first year of the BTech programme will be considered for

this programme change (without fail grades/backlogs). Change of programme from BTech-
MTech dual degree to regular BTech programme can be effected only once at the beginning

of the second year.
4. Graduation Requirements and Norms:
● Students enrolled in the dual degree programme have to earn a minimum of 72 credits, in
addition to the credits counted towards their BTech degree requirements. This is against the
80 credits required for regular MTech programme after BTech or equivalent degree.
● Students should obtain a minimum of 24 credits through courses and a minimum of 32 credits
through MTech thesis units. Note that the regular MTech requires minimum 32 credits through
courses and 32 credits of thesis units.
● The open elective requirement in the BTech programme of the student may be reduced by 4
credits.
● The student in sliding mode may have to do additional courses if they opt for an MTech
degree in a discipline other than their BTech discipline, which will be specified by the second
discipline during the change of programme.
● The students have to also successfully defend their MTech thesis to complete the
requirements of the dual degree.
● Single CPI will be maintained till the completion of all the requirements of both the degrees
and two separate CPIs will be mentioned in the final transcript, based on the graduation claim
made by the student. One CPI will be for all the courses claimed towards the BTech degree
and another based on all credits earned towards the MTech degree.
● The students may also opt for Honours in the same discipline and/or Minor(s) in other
discipline(s) as part of their BTech degree by clearing the additional requisite credits.
● Pass/fail conversion will be allowed only for two courses during the entire period of the dual
degree.
● All other norms such as substitution of courses will be applicable separately for the courses
counted towards BTech and MTech degrees.

Academic Affairs Advisory 39(Version 2.0 October 2022) Page 3
● If the student does not maintain a CPI of above 6.0 or have secured more than two U grades
in MTech thesis units, the student will be converted to the BTech programme.
● The maximum duration of the dual degree programme will be seven years.
5. Fellowship:
● Fellowship, as per prevailing rates for MTech students, may be paid to students opting for
the dual degree program for a maximum period of 12 months.
● The fellowship will begin after the eighth semester, subject to the student completing all the
requirements of the BTech degree.
● Students having a CPI of 8.0 or above (7.5 for students from SC/ST/PD category) at the end
of the 8th semester are eligible for the fellowship without having to appear for GATE. All other
students will need a valid GATE score (above the prescribed cut-off) to avail fellowship.
6. Tuition Fees: The students will deposit the tuition fees as per norms of the BTech programme
until completion of the eighth semester or completion of requirements of their BTech degree,
whichever is later. They will pay fees as per norms of the MTech programme (for candidates paid
a fellowship) afterwards, till completion of all requirements for the award of both the Degrees.
7. Award of Degrees: The student will be awarded both BTech and MTech degrees after
successfully completing all the requirements for the award of both the degrees.
8. Exit Options:
a) Sliding Mode: The student may request to opt out of the dual degree programme at any
point during the programme after giving valid reasons, and if the request is approved, the
student will be treated as in the BTech programme.
b) Direct Admission Mode: The BSc in Engineering degree will be an exit option for students
who are admitted to the BTech-MTech dual degree programme through the direct admission
route. Exit with a BTech is not an option for students in this programme, who remain in the
BTech-MTech dual degree after the beginning of the second year. B. BTech Curriculum (Applicable for students admitted before AY 2022-23)
The distribution of credits as well as sample academic plans for students admitted
before 2022-23 are shown in Annexure II.
C. Additional Learning
There is a provision of Honours and Minors available to students as an add on to the
base level BTech degree. The students will initially take admission in BTech programme
and will generally register for the minimum requirements of this base level programme.
Besides registering for a number of elective courses as part of their programme
requirement, the students will also be permitted to register for additional courses and
collect some additional credits. Students will not be required to declare the type of
elective or additional learning at the time of registration or during the course. They will
keep collecting these credits by successfully completing different courses during their
four years of stay by following their own planned academic path and aspirations in mind.
At the time of graduation, the students will claim their basic degree of BTech, or BTech
with Honours, or BTech with Minor(s) or BTech with Honours and with Minor(s) based
on the collected credits. The requirements of Honours and Minors are given below.
(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2022-23)
1. A student can receive a BTech (Honours) degree if they complete a minimum of 20
additional credits of courses specified by the parent discipline, over and above the
requirements of the base programme. This should include at least one project course
in the area of the parent discipline, in addition to the open project course. Further, two
open electives from the base programme, if it qualifies, may be counted in the 20
additional credits which are needed for Honours.
2. A student can receive a Minor in another discipline/focus area, if they complete a
minimum of 20 additional credits of courses specified by that discipline/focus area
group, over and above the requirements of the base programme. Two open electives
from the base programme, if it qualifies, may be counted in the 20 additional credits
which are needed for a Minor. Please refer to the advisory on Minors for more details

Academic Affairs Advisory No. 13 (Oct 2023) Page No. 5
about minors, including currently available minors and list of courses specified by
disciplines (if any).
(Applicable for all other students)
1. Honours: In addition to the requirements of the base level BTech degree, the students
will complete 20 credits of courses which enhance their core competence in their
discipline. It is possible that a course, which is not generally offered by the same
discipline but helps the students deepen their understanding in the core discipline, may
also be considered for Honours with the approval of the DPC and the DOAA. For
Honours, the student will be required to complete 08 credits of BTech projects
related to the discipline. One of the open elective courses of base programme, if it
qualifies, may be counted towards Honours, in which case the requirement of open
electives will reduce to 12 credits.
2. Minor: In addition to the requirements of the base level BTech degree, the students will
complete 20 credits of courses from another discipline which enhance their core
competence in that discipline. It is possible that a course, which is not generally offered
by that particular discipline but helps the students deepen their core understanding in
that discipline, may also be considered for Minor with the approval of the DPC and
DOAA. One of the open elective courses of base programme, if it qualifies, may be
counted towards Minor, in which case the requirement of open electives will reduce to
12 credits.
D. Academic Load
§ A student will normally register for 20 - 24 credits in a semester as per the respective
programme. Each course carries a weightage in terms of credits depending upon the
study load on the student and/or the number of contact hours (lectures and tutorials)
and/or laboratory hours.
§ There is no limit on the total number of project courses which a student can register
during their programme. However, a maximum of 16 credits of project courses can
be counted towards graduation requirements, irrespective of whether the student
claims for BTech or BTech with Honours.
§ A student may register up to a maximum of 28 credits in a semester. However,
Faculty Advisor may specify a lower limit than 28 credits.
§ A student who is placed on Guided Progress Scheme (GPS) can register for a
maximum of 21 credits. For detailed norms about GPS scheme, please refer
Academic Affairs Advisory on IWS.
§ A student with CPI of 7.0 or above may be recommended by the Faculty Advisor to take
an overload of one course (up to a maximum of 32 credits) subject to the approval of
Chair, SAPC. Any relaxation to the minimum CPI requirement for overload may be
considered by the Chair, SAPC based on the recommendation of DPC.
§ Similarly, Chair, SAPC may allow a student to take a reduced load. Also, a deficient
student may be required to take a reduced load as per the provisions/recommendations
of SAPEC/Faculty Advisor/SAPC/ decisions of the Senate.

§ A student can register for one-credit short courses in addition to any of the above-
mentioned limits of academic load. These courses are not counted as overload. These

credits are not considered in graduation requirements; however, the successfully
completed courses with their titles will be mentioned in the proficiency transcripts.

Academic Affairs Advisory No. 13 (Oct 2023) Page No. 6

§ A student is required to seek approval for academic overload/underload.
§ No student is allowed to register for more than 10 credits during the summer term.

§ The maximum period allowed to complete the programme will be six years (the first
year or first semester if repeated will not be counted).
F. Duration of the Programme
(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2023-24)
§ For all programmes, there will be no maximum permissible duration to complete the
requirements of the programme. However, at any time, credits earned older than eight
years will be deemed expired and will not count towards the graduation requirements.
§ After X years + 3 semesters, a request from the student is needed to extend the
programme on a semester by semester basis, where X is the nominal period for a given
programme (4 years for BTech/BSc and 5 years for BTech-MTech).
§ This is applicable for students admitted from AY 2023-24. However, students from
previous batches may opt for being considered under the above norms for duration of
the programme.
(Applicable for students admitted before AY 2023-24)
§ For the BTech programme, the maximum duration permitted, within which the
programme must be completed, is 12 semesters. If a student desires to finish his/her
BTech programme in seven semesters, by successfully completing the other graduation
requirements, he/she may be permitted to do so.

6,REVISED NORMS FOR GUIDED PROGRESS SCHEME FOR BTECH STUDENTS,Academic Affairs,BTech,"REVISED NORMS FOR GUIDED PROGRESS SCHEME FOR BTECH STUDENTS
(As approved by the Senate in its 18th meeting held on 25th September 2014, updated in the
23rd meeting held on 16th March 2016, 33rd Senate meeting held on 22nd November, 2018,
53rd meeting held on 27th July 2021, and 57th meeting held on 12th April 2022)
The Guided Progress Scheme (GPS) was introduced in 2014 to help academically weak B.Tech.
students develop and follow a plan for graduation from the Institute. The GPS primarily involves
restriction of the number of credits a student can register during a semester, and mapping of
students to an advisor, who advises them on the academic trajectory that should be followed. The
Senate in its 18th Meeting held on 25th September 2014 has approved revised norms for Guided
Progress Scheme (GPS) applicable to all B.Tech students with effect from Semester-I of
Academic Year 2014-15. These norms have been updated several times in subsequent Senate
meetings, details of which are placed below:

A. For B.Tech. students admitted earlier than 2020:
Entry (on recommendation of the SAPEC):
 Students who do not get a passing grade in a minimum of 14 credits in the first semester
will be placed in GPS for the subsequent semester. The credits for Foundation Programme
will not be considered in this count.
 Students who do not get a passing grade in a minimum of 16 credits in the second, third
or fourth semester will be placed in GPS for the next semester.
 After the first four semesters, students who do not receive passing grades in a minimum
of 32 credits in two consecutive semesters will be placed in GPS while keeping in mind
the course offerings in that semester and pending graduation requirements.
 In general, the students will be considered for entry into GPS up to their sixth semester.
After the sixth semester, only those students who have been in GPS in any previous
semesters will be considered to continue or enter into GPS.
While in GPS:
 Students will not be permitted to register for more than 21 credits in a semester.
 Students will prepare their study plan in consultation with both, their GPS and Faculty
Advisor while keeping in mind course offerings and timelines.
 Students under GPS must register for their backlog courses before registering for other
courses in that semester. However, GPS and Faculty Advisors may recommend
exceptions to avoid cascading effects.
 Class attendance, assignment submission and performance on various assessments will
be regularly monitored by GPS and Faculty Advisors.
Exit (on recommendation of the SAPEC):
 If a student gets a passing grade in at least 18 registered credits in a semester with a
minimum SPI of 6.0, OR
 If a student successfully earns 16 credits or more in each of two consecutive semesters.

B. For B.Tech. students admitted in Academic Year 2020-21 onwards:
Entry (on recommendation of the SAPEC):
 Students who are not able to secure a CPI of 5.0 or above at the end of first two semesters/
Term III will be placed in GPS.
 Students who have a CPI between 5.0 and 5.5, but would like to seek help through the GPS
support mechanisms, would be allowed to enter GPS.
While in GPS
 While in GPS, students will prepare their academic plan in consultation with both their GPS
and faculty advisors.
 The exact academic load of students in GPS would be decided based on the
recommendations of the GPS advisor and the faculty advisor. At any point of time, students
will not be able to register for fewer than 12 credits and more than 24 credits in a semester.
Exit (on recommendation of the SAPEC):
 Students will be able to exit the GPS when they are able to secure a CPI of 5.5 or a passing
grade in at least 18 registered credits in a semester with a minimum SPI of 6.0.

Any exceptions to these norms may be recommended by the SAPEC and approved by the
Chairman, Senate.",

Peer Assisted Learning (PAL) programme is an academic support scheme for the
undergraduate students launched by IIT Gandhinagar in October 2012. This programme is designed
on the philosophy that peer group of students play an extremely influential role in determining their
learning behavior. Students are known to actively seek advice from their peer group as they share
the same generational perspective. The PAL programme at IIT Gandhinagar initiated with a specific
aim to assist those first year students who face difficulties in adapting to English as the medium of
instruction in their coursework. These students are identified by counselors during one-on-one
interaction sessions that are held with the incoming batch of students during their first month on
campus. The senior students who serve as peer educators are selected by a faculty in-charge of the
PAL programme by inviting applications and conducting personal interviews in August every year.
In a model PAL session, a senior student (second or a third year) assists two first year
students by sharing his/her knowledge and experience that helps them adapt to the new learning
environment. The first year students and their peer educators meet for four hours every week for
PAL sessions, usually in the evenings. The peer educators are compensated for their service
through Earn While You Learn (EWYL) scheme at IIT Gandhinagar. The PAL sessions begin in

September every year and continue through Sem I and Sem II. During this period, the faculty in-
charge meets with peer educators periodically and keeps sharing righteous practices on mentoring

and interpersonal communication to enable them address needs of students more effectively.
The platform facilitated by PAL programme not only results in learning outside the
classrooms, it also encourages discussions regarding academic and any other concerns in an
informal peer environment. By seeking guidance from their peers, the students become more aware
of the resources available on campus and experience a gradual transition to the institute’s culture.
This results in an increased self-confidence among the students, which helps them on several fronts.
It was realized that some students can be further benefited from learning in a peer group, if
there are additional sessions dedicated to a specific course in which they can resolve their doubts. In
this view, an alternative peer group led activity, named Academic Help Sessions (AHS), was

conceptualized and initiated in August 2015. These help sessions are designed to provide a tutorial-
like platform to students where they can discuss technical details and problem solving skills (for an

identified course) with a small group of peer tutors everyday after dinner (9 pm-11 pm). These

Academic Affairs Advisory (Version 2.0, July 2016) Page 2
sessions are primarily aimed to help the first and second year students who are facing challenges in
specific courses. The instructors of the specific courses are also informed about sessions being run
and they are invited to participate and share their feedback. The sessions are coordinated by a
faculty in-charge who: (i) identifies the specific course, (ii) selects tutors from the senior students,
and (iii) periodically discuss the progress with the tutors. This group of peer tutors is also supported
through the EWYL scheme.
In acknowledgment of the increasing student-led academic activities, a student coordinator
will be selected every year (from 2016 onwards, as a member of Student Academic Council) to help
the faculty in-charges in ensuring regular conduct of the sessions, identifying competent tutors, and
establishing a mutual coordination among the tutors of various peer group led sessions.
It is promising to note that the involvement of peers is greatly helping us in reaching out to
students more effectively and it is gradually shaping as a valuable resource for the first and second
year students. Further, in addition to the recipients, the students serving as peer-educators are also
benefiting immensely in the process of executing their responsibilities. The peer-educators have a
rewarding and satisfying experience as they explore themselves while serving the community. We
are hopeful that this support scheme of involving peer educators will make seminal positive impacts
in the lives of students.",

10,Norms for Undergraduate Teaching Assistantship,Academic Affairs,BTech,"Norms for Undergraduate Teaching Assistantship

(As approved by the Senate in its 49th meeting held on 22nd February 2021)
IIT Gandhinagar attracts some of the best undergraduate (UG) students in the country.
While teaching such bright students is a great privilege, the Institute has an enormous
responsibility of grooming future engineers and leaders of the country. IITGN has therefore
placed a great emphasis on providing outstanding education while facilitating a holistic
development of students. To further enrich the educational experience of UG students, it is
proposed to add a new dimension to their learning, that prepares students for teaching.

The On-Campus Employment Opportunities (O-CEO), formerly known as the Earn-While-
You- Learn (EWYL) programme, has been a step in this direction. Although UG students

have occasionally participated in teaching activities through the EWYL/O-CEO programme,
the focus of the EWYL/O-CEO programme has largely been to develop job skills and
leadership skills through a variety of employment opportunities. A dedicated program, that
formally engages UG students in teaching, would not only provide an enriching academic
experience, it would also create an opportunity to develop teaching and mentoring skills
among the undergraduate students.
The Undergraduate Teaching Assistantship (UGTA) programme has been established to
provide teaching experience to UG students. Under the UGTA programme, the UGTAs are
expected to assist the instructors and tutors in the conduct of the course. It is expected that
engaging the UGTAs would facilitate an effective student engagement and learning, as
students are known to actively learn from their peer group because they share the same
generational perspectives. Some of the responsibilities of the UGTAs include:
1. Providing assistance to instructors and tutors in conduct of assessments.
2. Helping instructors and tutors in preparation of assignments, projects and other
learning activities
3. Guiding and mentoring of students by holding regular discussion sessions
4. Helping lab instructors and tutors in conduct of labs and tutorials
Eligibility:
1. Students enrolled in the Dual Major B.Tech. and Dual Degree programmes, who
have completed four semesters at IITGN, are also eligible to apply.
2. Students must have a CPI of 8.5 or above to be eligible to apply for the UGTA
programme. Students with a CPI of 7.5 or above are eligible to apply provided they
have secured an A or A- grade in the course for which they are applying to serve as
UGTA.
3. Students applying for this programme should not have any backlogs and should not
have received E or F grade in any course (>1 credit) at IITGN.
4. Students should have completed the specific course (or equivalent) for which they

(As approved by the BoG in its 29th meeting held on 20th August 2020)

Background
A number of undergraduate students joining the IIT system through the Joint Entrance
Examination (JEE) find it difficult to undergo rigorous academic programme at the IITs,
and are often faced with the prospect of having to leave the programme without obtaining
a degree. The difficulty in going through the curriculum may arise due to a variety of
reasons. Further, some of the students do go through the programme successfully with a
decent CPI, even though their career interests lie elsewhere (civil services, MBA, family
business, etc.).
IITGN has undertaken a number of steps to try and help students having academic
difficulties. For instance, the 5-week Foundation Programme at the beginning of the first
semester helps prepare the students to adjust in the new cultural milieu. The Counselling
Service proactively identifies students facing a variety of challenges and provides help.
An effective Guided Progress Scheme (GPS) has been developed, wherein the students
are paid special attention and are allowed reduced academic load. Students facing
difficulties with the English language are offered extra help via the Peer Assisted Learning
Program. Academic Discussion Hours, which are conducted in informal hostel spaces,
bring together junior and senior students for discussions on specific courses.
Despite these efforts, a few students still struggle to cope with the academic
requirements. This leads to high failure rates, which then trigger mental health problems.
With increasing student strength, and increasing number of distractions for the students,
this is likely to rise. This problem was also acknowledged at the level of the IIT Council,
and the Council in its 53rd meeting held on 27th November 2019 approved a proposal to
allow such students to exit the program upon completion of a “minimum academic
standard” with an alternate B.Sc. (Engineering) degree.
Graduation Requirements and Norms

1. A three-year B.Sc. degree in Engineering be created at IITGN, without any sub-
specialization.

2. This will only be an “Exit” degree and no separate admission will be offered into
this program.

Academic Affairs Advisory 52 (Version 1.0, July 2021) Page 1

3. The graduation requirements for this degree will be lower and fairly flexible in
order to enable students to exit comfortably with a degree (see Degree
Requirements).
4. Any undergraduate student (including existing students), may apply for
conversion to this program any time after the end of his/her fourth active
semester.
5. A student opting for this program will typically not be permitted to convert back to
the B.Tech. degree. In exceptional circumstances, the Chairman, Senate may
approve re-conversion to B.Tech. upon recommendation of the Dean, Academic
Affairs / Associate Dean (UG).
6. Instance of students exiting via the B.Sc. degree in Engineering should be rare,
and efforts should be made to encourage students to complete their B.Tech.
degree program.
Degree Requirements
1. A student opting to exit the institute with a B.Sc. degree in Engineering degree
will be required to complete at least 100 credits of coursework.
2. Out of these, at least 60 credits will have to be earned via courses in Engineering
and/or Natural Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Science, some
courses of Cognitive Science).

the Senate held on 20th July 2016 , 29th meeting of the Senate held on 11th December 2017, 33rd meeting of the
Senate held on 22nd November 2018 and 64th meeting of the Senate held on 10 May 2023)

I. Background
The Humanities and Social Sciences(HSS) group at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar (IITGN) offers
students in the BTech Programme courses aimed at developing essential skills in critical thinking and writing along
with the knowledge of literature, society, politics, history, arts and philosophies of the mind and body. It also offers
a PhD programme in HSS disciplines that provides personalized and intensive scholarly mentoring to guide original
research. The HSS faculty team at IITGN, with its diverse expertise, is uniquely equipped to offer a multidisciplinary
Masters Programme with an exceptional potential to attract best students in the country.
II. Why Masters programme?
§ The Masters Programme extends the aims and goals of IITGN to provide a well-rounded, broad based and
excellent education for the benefit of a larger community interested in both arts and sciences.
§ The multidisciplinary profile of faculty at IITGN aims to provide a programme that interweaves approaches
from different disciplines and addresses the gap of interdisciplinary learning in higher education in India.
§ The Programme gives to IITGN faculty and students a platform to disseminate research ideas and also
establish a dialogue with academia/industry/policy makers for collaborative research.
§ Given the strength and skills available in the Humanities and Social Sciences Group at IITGN, the
Programme is in a position to be a leading one in the country.
§ The Programme would enable students to pursue a PhD in any of the disciplines s/he chooses to specialize
in, and also be equipped to partake of a range of employment opportunities (media, NGOs, consultancy,
communications industry).
§ We envision this to be a broad Humanities and Social Sciences programme that gives students exposure to
the many disciplines that fall under HSS along with interconnections between them. For instance, a student
is able to understand how Political Science is different from History, in that one looks at structures of
governance and power, while the other has a more temporal emphasis. Having said that, the two disciplines
work in tandem and at the end of the course the student should be able to see that, enabling him/her to make
an informed choice about his/her academic focus in the future.
III. What are the focus areas?
The HSS at IITGN recognizes that an interdisciplinary approach to the study of culture, society and politics, will
ensure intellectual flexibility and rigor in the use of theory and methodology. To establish that, the programme is
organized around the following indicative and overlapping themes:

§ Identity and difference
§ Knowledge systems
§ Systems of power
§ Negotiations between arts and ideology
§ History and memory
§ Development and exclusion
§ Global and local systems

Through the rigorous coursework and guided research project, it is expected that students in the programme will

Academic Affairs Advisory 29 (July 2023) Page 2
be able to develop conceptual tools to critically analyze structural inequalities relating to gender, sexuality, class,
caste, national identity and find ways to address them more effectively.
IV. Curriculum Structure and other features of the programme
(a) Highly competitive awards will be available to support students in attending conferences or to participate in
summer internships at well recognized organizations/institutes.
(b) A minimum of 80 credits will be needed to successfully complete the programme. This includes a minimum
56 credits of coursework, and minimum of 20 credits of research project. Masters students in this programme
will be required to take 6 out of 10 available Core courses and the remaining credits will be complemented
by a cluster of electives. Students who were admitted before AY 2023-24, are required to complete 4 to 6 core
courses as per the list shown for such students in Appendix 1. A hypothetical roadmap indicating the credit
structure and tentative courses has been appended (See Appendix 2).
(c) The Electives in this programme include at least two courses (8 credits) from disciplines other than HSS
(Engineering/Natural Sciences). The goal of this unique provision is to give students an exposure to the range
of disciplines covered by the IITGN faculty community.
(d) Elective courses include those that are either offered by the parent discipline or aligned disciplines in the
general area of the programme of study. In some cases appropriate undergraduate courses could also be
offered as electives for the MA programme. However, electives could also be taken from the entire pool of
postgraduate as well as undergraduate courses offered by any discipline in the institute. In keeping with the
Institute’s philosophy of emphasizing the interdisciplinary approach, students are required to take at least 8
credits of courses arising from Engineering/Natural Sciences disciplines besides FP 602 – Writing (4
credits).
(e) Students can also take up an Independent Study (eg. Project courses) with any IITGN faculty member and
earn credits towards it. A maximum of 12 credits out of Electives can be acquired through Independent Study
courses.
(f) Over the first two semesters, students are encouraged to start thinking about acquiring research experience
through single or multiple projects and interact with faculty members. Before registering for research project
credits, an adviser will be identified for each student. Students will be required to submit a research report for
assessment purposes to the concerned faculty/committee on the work performed during the semester. Based
on the report, the committee/concerned faculty will award a letter grade for each discrete unit (4 credits) of
research project work.
(g) Research Project - This correlates with approximately six courses. At least 20 credits of research project work
will be expected as a requirement for successful completion of the MA program.
(h) Part of credit fulfillment may take place through a student’s immersion in institutions other than IITGN. In such
cases, equivalent credit transfer will be considered.
(i) Summer research internships/projects on or off campus are required as part of the Master’s curriculum to
help students to complement their research activities, build networks/professional references and advance
their career aspirations.
(j) Completing PG Orientation Programme Aarohan (2 Credits) is a mandatory graduation requirement for all
MA students. [Note: The two credits for Aarohan is in addition to the minimum credit requirements of 80 credits
required for completing graduation requirements].
§ Aarohan is a two-week long programme that all the newly joined students are expected to
successfully complete before they commence the first semester in their academic programme. It would

Academic Affairs Advisory 29 (July 2023) Page 3
have 5 themes (Inventing and Discovering, Communication, Professionalism and Ethics, Social
Engagement, Well-being).
§ In cases where a student fails to clear Aarohan, they must clear an additional two credits worth of HSS
courses for graduation (applicable for all students who join from Semester – II, 2022-23 onwards).
(k) Students joining the MA programme (from semester – I, 2021-22 onwards) must complete two Physical
Education (PE) courses, one each in their first two semesters, as part of their graduation requirements.
These courses will be evaluated on a Pass/No Pass grade basis.
(l) The minimum eligibility criteria for applying to the Master’s programme is as follows: Bachelor’s degree in
any examination (e.g. BA/BSc (Hons), BTech, BE, etc.) with at least 55% marks in aggregate (5.5 CGPA for
students with letter grades/CGPA) for General/OBC category candidates and at least 50% aggregate marks
(5.0 CGPA for students with letter grades/CGPA) for SC, ST and PwD category candidates.
(m) The admission process will include a combination of review of application, an entrance examination and
interviews. However, the faculty will review the effectiveness of admission process to fine-tune it from time to
time.
V. Early Termination
(Applicable for students admitted from AY 2023-24)
§ Any student failing to earn a minimum of 28 credits within one year from his/her start of the first year
programme (either due to admission or due to restart) should start his/her programme afresh or exit the
programme. A student needs to secure a passing grade for earning the credits registered for the course.
§ If the programme is restarted, then the credits earned and semesters registered prior to restart will not be
carried over.
§ Restart will be permitted only once.
§ In case the CPI of a student falls below 6.0 out of 10, the fellowship provided, if any, by the Institute will be
stopped immediately and for the future.
§ There will be no maximum permissible duration to complete the requirements of the programme. However,
at any time, credits earned older than eight years will be deemed expired and will not count towards the
graduation requirements.
(Applicable for students admitted before AY 2023-24)
§ Any student failing to earn a minimum of 26 credits at the end of first two registered (active) semesters can
either apply to start his/her programme afresh or will have to exit the programme.
§ If the programme is restarted, then the credits earned and semesters registered prior to restart will not be
carried over.
§ If a student fails to earn 26 credits in the first two semesters but successfully completes 15 or more credits
in the second active semester, then only the first semester will be repeated, i.e., the student will be deemed
to have fresh start from the second active semester.
§ The restart will be permitted only once.

Academic Affairs Advisory 29 (July 2023) Page 4
§ Upon restart, the student must successfully complete a minimum of 12 credits at the end of first semester
and a minimum of 26 credits at the end of first two semesters, or else his/her admission will be terminated
and no further chance shall be given.
§ The maximum period allowed to complete the programme will be three years (the first year or first semester

2013, updated in the 30th Meeting of the Senate held on 17th April 2018 and in

50th Meeting of the Senate held on 19th April 2021)

1. IIT Gandhinagar encourages its students, both undergraduate and postgraduate,
towards research. There is provision of a modest cash incentive to the students
of the Institute for journal publications. Such an incentive is expected to
a. Communicate in unequivocal manner the Institute’s focus towards research,
b. Help quantify the research output of the students in individual academic
streams/ groups/ departments and set goals and benchmarks,
c. Recognize students who do well in research and create role models, and
d. Provide financial incentive to students who otherwise face several
disadvantages over their counterparts in the older IITs.
2. The eligible papers must be:
a. Published in a journal listed on the ISI Web of Science or presented in a
highly rated conferences in case the field is Computer Science and
Engineering.
b. Must list the affiliation of the concerned student as IIT Gandhinagar in an
unambiguous manner.
c. The quality of paper be assessed by a faculty group to establish the academic
adequacy of the publication.
3. In the field of Computer Science and Engineering, publications presented in
A* (Exceptional), A (Excellent), and B (Very Good to Good) rated
conferences are to be considered for cash awards upon careful evaluation of the
papers and subsequent recommendations of the Dean (AA). The quality of
papers presented in conferences that are rated as C (Sound and Satisfactory)
however, would need additional assessment and recommendations by a
committee duly appointed by the Dean (AA), before considering them for
publication cash awards. The CORE portal (2018, 2020 or later) will be the only
source for conference ratings for consideration of publication cash awards.
4. In some areas (such as Humanities and Social Sciences), it may be more
appropriate for the students to publish their research elsewhere (and not in the
journals listed on ISI Web of Science). Should a student feel that his/her work
published elsewhere should be considered for the cash award, he/ she may seek

Academic Affairs Advisory 16 (October 2022)
a case-by-case exemption from the requirement of clause 2(a) above by
submitting a written justification.
5. Any registered BTech, MSc, MA or MTech student (full- or part-time) of IITGN
who publishes an eligible paper will be given a cash award of Rs 25,000. In
case the paper is authored by more than one student of IITGN, the amount of Rs
25,000 will be shared by them.
6. A student can receive a maximum of Rs 50,000 under this scheme during
his/her degree programme.
7. In many cases, the review process at the journal end causes considerable delays
in acceptance and publication of the paper. A student may claim the cash award
for upto 3 years after the date of completion of his/her degree requirements.
Further, on a case-by-case basis, the committee may recommend the award
even if the paper is not yet published but is accepted for publication by the journal
without requiring any further corrections.
8. A Committee will examine the applications and recommend the cash awards to
the Director for approval. The Committee will normally be chaired by Dean of
Academic Affairs or Dean Research and Development.

(As approved by the Senate in its 13th meeting held on 11th March 2013 and updated in
the 24th Senate meeting held on 20th July 2016, 39th Senate meeting held on 27th
November 2019 and updated in 41st meeting of the Senate held on 17th February 2020
and 55th meeting of the Senate held on 06th October 2021)
1. Two-Year M.Sc. Programme: Introduction
Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN) introduced two-year Master of Science
(M.Sc.) programme from the academic year 2013-2014. The M.Sc programme in Chemistry,
Mathematics and Cognitive Science was initiated in 2013 followed by the inclusion of Physics
to the fold in 2014. The chief motivators for introducing the Two-Year M.Sc. programme are
as follows:
 Create a unique educational experience for students, especially those who may be
interested in research careers.
 Exploit the broad span of current faculty’s teaching and research expertise.
 Create another layer of engaged and research-active post-graduate scholars in the
institute, in addition to those that are part of M.Tech. / M.A. programmes.
2. Philosophy of Two-Year M.Sc. Programme
The Two-Year M.Sc. programme at IITGN strives to create a niche for itself, in a world that is
flooded with M.Sc. degree offerings. The proposed structure of the programme includes the
following features that echo the core philosophies of the institute:
 Enable students to acquire substantial breadth and depth in their areas of study.
 Orient and enable student attitudes towards scientific research.
 Expose students to areas beyond their core subjects.
 Mandatory curriculum components originating from humanities and social sciences.
3. Admission/Selection Procedure
Admission to the Two-Year M.Sc. programme will be on the basis of qualification in Joint
Admission to Masters (JAM) examination being administered by the IIT system. Students may
also join via Early-admit M.Sc. The emphasis on scholarly and research activities in IITGN’s
Two-Year M.Sc. programme may be factors for considering the following possibilities in future:
 Conducting interviews on JAM qualifiers.
 Allowing students in one discipline who have qualified national level examination in
that discipline to pursue a Master’s in another discipline.
Disciplines that do not fall under the current purview of JAM may develop an appropriate
selection strategy comprising viva voce and /or written examinations at the institute.
4. Curriculum Structure
 The Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics disciplines have a two-track structure for their
M.Sc. programs – a “coursework” track and a “research” track.
 The coursework track emphasizes a larger number of core courses in the respective
disciplines, while still including a flavor of research through project work. In contrast, the

research track will emphasize fewer core courses but greater research depth. It is
generally expected that research done in the research track will be of
publishable/patentable quality.
 All students at the end of their second semester will be given an option to choose the
track they wish to pursue. Any student with a CPI of greater than or equal to 7.0 will be
allowed to choose the track of his/her choice. Students whose CPI is below 7.0 may be
given their choice after suitable consultations with the discipline faculty.
 The Cognitive Science M.Sc. program will continue along a single track, but will, in spirit
be aligned with the research track of the other three disciplines.
A. Credit structure:
The Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics disciplines have the following detailed breakup
of credit structure within the two tracks. The Cognitive Science discipline has the following
credit structure and will only have the research track.

COURSEWORK TRACK RESEARCH TRACK
Chemistry Physics Math Chemistry Physics Math Cognitive
Science
Core 40 44 44 32 36 36 24

Total 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
#Summer Internship
*One of the HSS courses will be compulsory “Writing” course.
B. Course Structure: Basic framework of the curriculum will include the following:
1. Core courses: These are courses deemed essential to be part of the Master’s curriculum
in the specified discipline.
2. Elective courses: These courses include those that are either offered by the parent
discipline or aligned disciplines in the general area of the programme of study. In some
cases appropriate undergraduate courses could also be offered as electives for the M.Sc.
programme. However, electives could also be taken from the entire pool of post-graduate
as well as undergraduate courses offered by any discipline in the institute.
3. HSS courses: In keeping with the institute’s philosophy of emphasizing the role of
humanities and social sciences, students are required to take at least 8 (research track) or
12 (coursework track) credits of courses arising from those disciplines. The 4-credit
“Writing” course will be required for all students.
C. Nature of Research During Two-Year M.Sc.: The nature of “research” performedduring
M.Sc. is defined as:
i. Students will be required to select the general area and type of work at the end of

the first semester and identify faculty member(s) willing to act as supervisor. Co-
supervision by up to one faculty member may be permitted.

ii. Students may choose supervisor from outside their own disciplines and work under
any advisor in the institute.
iii. Research project work can be research-oriented, developmental, industrially
relevant, or a combination of these. The type of work selected would primarily
depend on the interest of the student and the faculty supervisor(s).

iv. While, the nature of research/project work is mostly left to individual faculty
supervisors, close ended projects will be preferred in the initial years. It is
conceivable that within a few years of the programme, enough experience will be
accumulated to permit open ended research projects with no deadline for
submission.
v. Supervisors will award a letter grade for the total number of credits of
research/project work.
vi. Towards the end of the programme, the student will be expected to submit a
comprehensive report for assessment by an evaluation committee of at least 3
members with the supervisor chairing that committee.
vii. The students will be expected to register during the summer at the end of first year
for up to 12 credits.
viii. The advisorship of research projects may change during the course of the
programme. Such changes/switches will be assessed purely on the basis of
performance in each project. In such cases, the student can compile all the work
into one report for submission and evaluation.
ix. Mode of assessment of research projects is left at the discretion of disciplines. The
assessment criterion being currently used for judging B.Tech. project progress may
be used for guidance in this regard.
x. It is expected that engagement of students in research during the two-year M.Sc.
programme will translate into peer-reviewed publications.
D. Criteria for Continuing in the Two-Year M.Sc. Programme
i. A student who fails to earn a minimum of 8 credits at the end of his/her first active
semester must ordinarily exit the programme. However, he/she may make an
earnest request to continue into the second semester by submitting a strong
justification and a clear work/graduation plan. Both of these must be vetted by the
student’s faculty advisor, who must also provide a detailed rationale for why the
student may be allowed to continue. This request may be reviewed by the Dean
(Academics), who will then present the case to the Senate for a decision.
Favourable decisions are to be rare and given in exceptional circumstances.
ii. The request to continue must be received in time, i.e., well before the date of
registration of the student’s potential second semester. If the request is not
received by this time, it will be presumed that the student is no longer interested
and the student’s programme will be terminated.
iii. If the request for continuation is approved by the Senate, the student may register
for the second semester. If this student fails to earn at least 26 credits at the end
of his/her first two active semesters, he/she must exit the programme. However, at
this point, the student will have the opportunity to restart the programme afresh.
The restart option can be exercised only once.
iv. If the programme is restarted, then the credits earned and semesters registered
prior to restart will not be carried over.
v. Upon restarting, the student must earn a minimum of 12 credits in his/her first
semester and 15 credits in the second semester or else his/her programme will be
terminated and no further chance will be given.
vi. The maximum period allowed to complete the programme will be three years (the
first year or first semester if repeated will not be counted).
vii. In case Institute fellowship/ scholarship has been provided during the failed
semesters, it will be adjusted in the following semesters.
E. Other Provisions of the Two-Year M.Sc. Programme
i. Students who have performed exceptionally in the two-year M.Sc. programme may
be offered direct entry into the Ph.D. programme at IITGN. Disciplines may decide
criterion for judging exceptional performance (e.g. CPI) of students.
ii. Outstanding performers may also be considered for short internships in prominent
institutes worldwide. Work performed in such internships may be applied towards

research/project work credits. Disciplines may decide the number, duration and
timing of such internships.

(As approved by the BoG in its 28th meeting held on 02 January 2020)

The Board of Governors of the Institute in its 28th meeting held on 20 January 2020 approved
the introduction of Early Admit M.Sc Program from Academic Year 2020-21.
Background: The Institute will initiate Early Admit M.Sc program to enhance the quality of M.Sc.
admissions in the disciplines of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics at the Institute. Currently,
students are recruited into these programs solely based on their score and rank in the JAM
(Joint Admission Test for M.Sc.) exam. It is envisioned that such an “Early Admit M.Sc.”
program, modeled along the lines of the Early Admit M.Tech. program, where students from
select colleges around the country are recruited, will be instrumental in targeting top-ranked
students and attracting them to IITGN.
Objective: To attract high-quality students into the Institute’s M.Sc. (Physics, Chemistry and
Mathematics) programs.
Eligibility:
 Students currently enrolled in the final year of the undergraduate program at select
institutions in India can apply.
 B.Tech students in any discipline from the colleges included in the Start Early Ph.D.
program list can apply.
 The first five rank-holders in the class (at the end of the pre-final year) will be eligible. The
Department Head / Principal / Director of the respective institute will need to issue a rank
certificate.
 A valid JAM/GATE score will not be mandatory.
Tuition Fees, Curriculum, Other Norms: These will be similar to that of the regular M.Sc.
program at IITGN.
Selection Process: Students will be selected from approximately 40 select academic
institutions in the country based on their academic performance (current rank in the class as
certified by authorities in the parent institute), a written test and/or interview.
Other details:
 Since this is an experimental initiative the students admitted through the Early Admit
M.Sc program will be supernumerary and will not count in the sanctioned strength for the
admission to these programs through JAM.
 A scholarship of Rs. 5000 per month be given to students admitted through the Early
Admit M.Sc. program. This scholarship will continue only if the student maintains a CPI of
8.0 or above.
 This program will be closely monitored in terms of its impact in attracting quality students
and modified year to year till it stabilizes.",

20,NORMS FOR MTECH PROGRAMME,Academic Affairs,MTech,"NORMS FOR MTECH PROGRAMME

(Senate in its 4th Meeting held on 2nd December 2010 approved the following
which was updated in the 24th Senate meeting held on 20th July 2016, 36th
meeting of the Senate held on 13th June 2019, 39th Senate meeting held on 27th
November 2019, 44th meeting of the Senate held on 08th July 2020 and the 60th

meeting of the Senate held on 26th September 2022)

The MTech programme at IITGN will be of two years duration and will consist of
coursework as well as a project/thesis leading to a dissertation, with equal emphasis
placed on both these aspects. The coursework would be broad-based to provide
knowledge in the field a student wishes to pursue. The project would serve to engage and
train students to inculcate in them the abilities for independent thinking, and to integrate
knowledge towards the solution of R&D problems. The programme will aim at graduating
well-rounded engineers ready to pursue leadership careers in R&D, teaching or industry.
Coursework:
• Students will require 32-48 credits of course work, 32-48 credits of thesis (as
per the credit system of 3 lectures per week courses bearing 4 credits) and 2
credits of postgraduate orientation programme Aarohan. Note that the total
minimum credit requirement is 82. [Note: The disciplines may specify a
minimum course work/thesis work requirement of more than 32 credits.]
• The course work will consist of the following components:
§ The 4-credit “Writing” course will be required for all students.
§ In addition to this, at least 4 credits will have to be earned through Humanities
and Social Sciences (HSS) courses. One undergraduate level HSS course
may be counted towards this requirement.
§ Students must take at least 8 credits of electives inside or outside the
discipline. The choice of elective courses will be the student’s discretion, but
must be taken in consultation with the faculty advisor.
§ Students must take at least 16 credits of courses specified by the
discipline. Importantly, this does not mean only the courses of the student’s
home discipline. For instance, a discipline may specify that a certain
Mathematics course is required for all its students; such a course will be
included in this basket. [Note: Please check with the discipline to see the list
of courses which can be counted under this basket.]

Academic Affairs Advisory 05 (October 2022)
§ Two undergraduate level courses may be counted towards graduation
requirements (besides the UG level HSS course).
§ Students joining the MTech programme (from semester – I, 2021-22 onwards)
must complete two Physical Education (PE) courses, one each in their first
two semesters, as part of their graduation requirements. These courses will be
evaluated on a Pass/No Pass grade basis.
Postgraduate Orientation Programme (Aarohan):
• Completing PG Orientation Programme Aarohan (2 Credits) is a mandatory
graduation requirement for all MTech students. It is a two-week long programme
that all the newly joined students are expected to successfully complete before
they commence the first semester in their academic programme.
• It would have 5 themes (Inventing and Discovering, Communication,
Professionalism and Ethics, Social Engagement, Well-being).
• Successful completion of the program may be mandatory for release of
fellowship to the students.
• In cases where a student fails to clear Aarohan, they must clear an additional two
credits worth of HSS courses for graduation (applicable for all students who join
from Semester – II, 2022-23 onwards).
Thesis/Project:
Although students will be required to earn equal credits for the thesis and coursework,
the open-ended nature of the project will demand considerably more time compared to
the coursework. Following are some the procedural details of the thesis/project work:
• Thesis work can be research-oriented, developmental, industrially relevant, or a
combination of these. The type of work selected for the thesis would primarily
depend on the interest of the student and the faculty supervisor(s).
• Thesis will be open ended with no deadline for submission. A student may
submit when the work is completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor(s).
• As a bench mark of expectations, it is expected that the work carried out for an
MTech thesis will be published in a reputed scholarly peer-reviewed journal
or conference proceedings. The Institute may review periodically the percentage
of theses meeting this criterion (that is, if the work of thesis has been published) to

Academic Affairs Advisory 05 (October 2022)
assess the health of its MTech programme and make appropriate changes in
structure of the programme.
• Students should select the area and type of work at the end of the first
semester and identify a faculty member willing to act as thesis supervisor. Thesis
co-supervision by up to two faculty members may be permitted. It will also be
possible for the students to choose supervisor from disciplines other than their own
discipline, if appropriate. In some cases, one thesis supervisor may be from
outside the Institute, but the total number of supervisors will still not exceed two.
• It is normally expected that students will not register for the thesis in their first
semester, while they would register for thesis credits in the remaining three
semesters.
• Most MTech students will be receiving Government funded scholarship and are
expected to spend winter and summer vacation period towards their thesis
research. For instance, the students will be expected to register for about 10
credits of thesis in summer unless there is a specific waiver on justifiable
grounds.
• Each student would have a three or four member ""thesis committee"" chaired
by thesis supervisor. The Committee will periodically monitor progress of the
student and advise on mid-course corrections.
• A student registered for thesis units will be required to submit a research report
and make an oral presentation to the thesis committee on the work performed
during the semester. Based on the report and presentation, thesis supervisor(s) in
consultation with the committee, will award a satisfactory or unsatisfactory (S/U)
grade for each discrete credit of thesis work. A thesis credit which is awarded
U grade will not be counted towards completion of the required thesis
credits, and will, therefore, have to be repeated by the student in a later semester
or during summer. Grades of thesis units are not counted for the calculation of
SPI/CPI.
• PGDIIT can be awarded to regular MTech candidates who successfully finish the
coursework requirement of 32-48 credits but do not wish to register for Thesis work
or are not found suitable for Thesis work by the “thesis committee”. However, an
award of PGDIIT to such candidates is contingent upon the Institute approval
and such candidates may have to refund the scholarship received by him/her
during the period of coursework.

Academic Affairs Advisory 05 (October 2022)
Academic Performance Requirements:
• The minimum CPI for graduation is 6.0 out of 10.
• The minimum CPI for continuing in the programme at any point is 5.5 out of
10. That is, if at any stage, the student has a CPI less than 5.5, the programme will
be terminated.
• In case the CPI of a student falls below 6.0 or the student accumulates three or
more Us towards thesis grades at any point of time, the fellowship provided by the
Institute will be stopped permanently. The student may seek financial support from
projects or other Institute activities through individual effort.
• In exceptional cases, continuation of the fellowship may be approved by the
Director on recommendation of Dean, Academic Affairs.
• Full-time MTech student will have maximum of three years to obtain the degree.
A summary of the credits requirements is mentioned in the table below (Note: The
disciplines may specify a credit requirement which is different from the table given below):

programme will target good students of the same colleges as in Start Early Ph.D programme. Hence, it
is expected to support further the relationship building the select set of good colleges in the country.

1. Introduction: This proposal is to initiate the “Early Admit M.Tech. Programme” at the Indian
Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar. Top students from reputed colleges in the country will
be selected in the fourth year of their B.Tech./B.E. programme.

2. Objective: This programme is intended to attract top quality students at Masters’ level.

3. Eligibility:
● B. Tech. students currently enrolled in the fourth year of undergraduate programme at select
institutions in India can apply for this programme.
● First five rank-holders in the class (at the end of third year) will be eligible to apply. The head of
the department or the Director of the respective institute will need to issue a rank certificate.
● A fourth year B. Tech. student at an IIT with a CPI/CGPA above 6.0 (at the end of third year)
will also be eligible to apply.
● A valid GATE score will not be mandatory.

4. Scholarship: A scholarship to support the selected students shall be provided for a maximum
of 24 months.
● Rs. 12,400/- + Rs. 3000/- per month (with a valid GATE score)
● Rs. 6000/- per month (without a valid GATE score)
A student may join without GATE score, but in first year of M.Tech may appear in GATE. If he/
she qualifies, the scholarship from prospective date (after passing the GATE) will be enhanced.

Academic Affairs Advisory 42(Version 2.0, August 2019 Page 2
5. Tuition fee, curriculum structure and other regulations: The fees structure, the curriculum
as well as other regulations will be same as that of the regular M. Tech. programme at IIT
Gandhinagar.

6. Selection process: The students will be selected from the reputed academic institutions of the
country based on the past academic performance (current rank in the class as certified by the
authorities in the parent institute), a written test and/or an interview. The students eligible for Start
Early Ph.D. programme will also be eligible for this programme.

7. List of institutions: The list of institutions considered for this programme will be same as that
for the Start Early Ph.D. programme.
8. Continuation of additional fellowship: The continuation of additional fellowship beyond the
first semester is subject to the student maintaining a CPI 8.0 and above. In addition, the
additional fellowship may be discontinued if a student secures a U grade in his/her M.Tech. thesis",

(Senate in its 4

th Meeting held on 2

nd December 2010 approved the following)
There are several industries in the neighborhood of this institute and professionals working
there are quite often unable to spend the necessary duration on campus to fulfill the
requirements of an M.Tech. programme. Also, several aspirants are observed to show
genuine interest in advancing their knowledge and qualification in spite of a long break after
B.Tech. The Post-Graduate Diploma of IIT(PGDIIT) programme can be useful as a stepping
stone for such professionals to assess themselves for higher studies and improve their
technical understanding and skills in the process.
Salient Features of Programme
 Working professionals with industrial experience and Bachelor’s degree in
Engineering/Technology/Architecture/Pharmacy or Master’s degree in any branch of
Science/ Mathematics/ Statistics/ Computer Applications or equivalent will be eligible to
apply.
 Industry sponsorship is not mandatory for admission to this programme. However,
candidates are encouraged to get a support from industry for them to pursue this
programme.
 To encourage professionals from small and medium scale industries, fees for PGDIIT
candidates will initially be the same as those for M.Tech students so that they can derive
the benefits from this program.
 The admission procedure for PGDIIT programme should be defined by the individual
disciplines (it may, for example, consist of a written test and/or an interview)
 A candidate pursuing PGDIIT should successfully finish the coursework requirement of
32 credits (equivalent of 8 courses) with a minimum CPI of at least 5.0 for award of the
diploma.
 The PGDIIT programme may include a minor Project (12 credits).
 A candidate can choose the courses of his/her choice from the pool of courses being
offered for the regular M.Tech programme.
 However, individual disciplines may offer specialized PGDIIT programme, where they will
prescribe the minimum number of courses from the area of specializations. This will lead
to an award of PGDIIT in that particular discipline or specialization.
 A candidate can design his/her own course work apart from the bare minimum courses
prescribed by the institutes (e.g. A course in communication skills can be a compulsory
course)
 PGDIIT programme can be a full time (4 courses per semester) or a part-time
programme (at least 2 or more courses per semester). However, it has to be completed
in a maximum period of 3 years.

Academic Affairs Advisory 06 (Version 1.0, July 2012) Page 2
 In a long-term, PGDIIT course work can suitably be developed in collaboration with
reputed research organizations/institutes/industries to suit their needs.

 A candidate enrolled in PGDIIT can apply to enroll for M.Tech degree provided he/she
earns SPI of 6.0 and above, and CPI of 6.5 and above. Once admitted to M.Tech
programme, such candidates will have to fulfil the requirement of M.Tech thesis/project
for an award of M.Tech degree.",
25,NORMS FOR WORK AND STUDY M.TECH. PROGRAMME,Academic Affairs,MTech,"NORMS FOR WORK AND STUDY M.TECH. PROGRAMME
(As approved by the BoG in its 30th meeting held on 17 December 2020 and
updated in the 49th meeting of the Senate held on 22nd February 2021)
The Board of Governors of the Institute in its 30th meeting held on 17 December 2020
in-principle approved to have a provision of Work and Study M.Tech. programme to
create a specialized workforce for major facilities/laboratories and research projects
within the Institute. The M.Tech. graduation requirements will remain unchanged in
this programme, but the enrolled students can complete it over a period of 3 years (or
more) while working for 20 hours per week within the Institute.
The students admitted under the Work and Study M.Tech. programme can complete
their coursework and thesis requirements at a relatively slower pace while working in
the Institute. The normal time for graduation for these students will be 3 years, and the
maximum period of graduation will be 5 years. Their tuition fees will be the same as
for the regular full-time MTech students with Institute fellowship. These students will
receive an assistantship of 18,000/- per month to serve 20 hours per week in their host
Facility/Laboratory/Project for the entire duration of their programme. The
assistantship provided to a student may be extended beyond 36 months, subject to
the performance and established need in the host facility/laboratory. Faculty members
can also recruit these students on sponsored research projects where a long
association of students with the research project can bring immense benefit to both
faculty and student. The host facility or faculty members can also provide an additional
assistantship amount from their project funds or other available funding sources to
attract and retain the best talent.
1. Scope and Principle
(i) All candidates enrolled in the Work and Study M.Tech. program would be
associated with a major facility in the Institute  such as Central
Instrumentation Facility (CIF), Computer Center (CC), Informational
Systems and Technology Facility (ISTF), Institute Management System

for shortlisting. However, the candidates with significant industrial
experience or with evidence of excellent academic record be granted
exemption.
(vii) The final selection of the candidates will be based on their performance in
the written test and/or interview.

3. Educational plan
(i) The students enrolled in the Work and Study M.Tech. programme are
expected to earn minimum 80 credits as per the graduation requirements of
the regular M.Tech. programme. However, they will be completing these
requirements at a relatively slower pace. The normal duration of program
for these students would be three years. The maximum duration for
completing the program, however, will be five years.
(ii) The students enrolled in this program would be allowed to register for a
maximum of 12 credits in a regular semester and a maximum of 8 credits
during summer term, including credits earned through online courses.
(iii) The students are expected to register for a minimum of 8 credits in a regular
semester and a minimum of 4 credits during the summer term.

Academic Affairs Advisory (Version 1.1, July 2021) Page 3 of 3

Advisor for work related matters, and Faculty Advisor for thesis and
coursework related matters. It is possible that in some cases the same
faculty member can serve both the advisory roles.
(ii) A monthly progress report will be sent by the work advisor to the R&D office
for release of fellowship. The students enrolled in this programme would be
submitting a time card at the end of every month detailing the work carried
out. The work advisor will rate the progress as Above Expectations/As Per
Expectations/Below Expectations every month.
(iii) For continuing in the programme, the students are expected to satisfy both
the work as well as the academic expectations. In case a student
consistently accumulates ‘Below Expectations’ ratings from the work
advisor, or if the CPI of the student falls below 5.0, at any point of time from
second semester onwards, he/she will be liable to be terminated from the
academic programme.

27,Norms for e-Masters Degree Programme,Academic Affairs,e-Masters and Focus School,"Norms for e-Masters Degree Programme
(As approved by the BoG in its 34

th meeting held on 28 April 2022)

Overview: The rapidly evolving technology landscape is making it indispensable for
professionals to continually upgrade their skill sets. A platform that enables practicing
professionals to build expertise in a focused knowledge domain is expected to add
immense value to individuals as well as corporate organizations. To create such a
platform, an e-Masters degree program has been introduced at IITGN. The candidates
admitted under this program would typically undertake 32 credits of coursework
focusing on an advanced knowledge domain. The program may be in areas of our
expertise or in areas addressing present societal needs, like Safety Engineering,
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. The program would be
generally spread over a duration of 1 year; this program would not have a thesis
requirement.
The following points summarize some important aspects of the program:
1. Scope and Principle
● This program is intended for working professionals who wish to enhance their
knowledge in emerging areas.
● The program has a flexible executive-friendly structure enabling the enrolled
candidates to concurrently work in their existing professions.
● The program is designed for a duration ranging from 6 months to 2 years,
depending on the nature of the domain in which e-Masters would be offered.
● The participants enrolled in the program are expected to complete the
program requirements in a maximum of 3 years.
2. Admissions
● Details of the specific program (nature of the domain in which e-Masters is
proposed to be offered, suite of courses required for specialization) would be
developed by a faculty group or discipline, and presented before the SAPC
and the Senate for further consideration.
● The academic office would develop the corresponding implementation details
(e.g. number of positions available, supplementary advertisement) from time
to time in consultation with the faculty group or discipline.
● Candidates with Bachelor’s degree will be eligible to apply to this program;
they are not required to have a GATE score.
● Candidates, with two or more years of cumulative experience, would be given
a preference. Candidates with excellent academic records may, however, be
provided an exception.
● Specific programs may develop their own criteria from time to time, over and
above the Senate-approved minimum qualifications, for shortlisting the best
candidates.

Academic Affairs Advisory 55 (Version 1.0, May 2022) Page 2 of 3
● The shortlisted candidates would appear for a written test and/or interview
conducted by the specific programs based on which their final selection would
be made. Specific programs may decide from time to time a suitable mode
(online or offline) for conducting the written test/interview.
● The recommendations for admissions will be made through the Dean of
Academic Affairs to the Director for approval.
3. Educational plan
● The candidates enrolled in the e-Masters programme are expected to earn a
minimum of 32 credits of coursework by completing a suite of courses
recommended for specialization.
● The coursework will consist of the following components:
- Foundational Courses to rebuild the fundamentals in the focused domain
(minimum of 4 credits)
- Core Courses to build expertise in the focused domain (minimum of 16
credits)
- Humanities and leaderships courses to nurture critical thinking,
creativity, communication, teamwork, and initiatives (minimum of 4
credits)

● The courses would integrate synchronous and asynchronous modes of
learning. The schedules may be designed such that the live sessions would
be conducted over the weekends, suited to the schedules of working
professionals. These live sessions would be complemented by the self-paced
learning components (reading material and recorded videos), helping the
professionals to learn at their disposal.

● The courses offered by the institute in other programs may be extended to e-
Masters students with prior permission on a case-to-case basis.

● The courses offered in this program may be aligned with the regular semester
or the summer term.
● The candidates enrolled in this program are expected to spend a minimum of
two weeks on campus, which would enable them to experience campus,
obtain hands-on learning through lab sessions, network with experienced
professionals, and complete any in-person evaluations. Candidates, who
intend to stay on campus for durations longer than two weeks, would be
suitably facilitated for the same.
● The residency requirement may be waived for some programs and
international candidates. In such scenarios, an equivalent academic
requirement should be appropriately designed by the specific program and
fulfilled by the participant.
● The courses would generally be conducted through online learning platforms
by subject-matter experts from industry and academia from India and abroad.
● The honorarium and/or coordination fees to the resource persons would be
paid as per the norms of IITGN-X. The coordinators can invite resource
persons (instructors and teaching associates) for conducting the courses or
sessions for assisting in the same. For some courses, a higher rate of

Academic Affairs Advisory 55 (Version 1.0, May 2022) Page 3 of 3
honorarium/coordination fees may be needed. In such cases, IITGN-X will
negotiate with the internal and external stakeholders, and accordingly propose
it to the Director for approval, through Dean R&D, from time to time.
4. Assessment
● The performance evaluation of a candidate would be carried out by awarding

a letter grade in each of his/her courses by the concerned Instructor-in-
Charge. A performance index (PI, weighted average of grade points in all the

courses accredited) would be maintained for these candidates.
● The candidates would have a maximum of 3 years to complete the program.
● e-Masters students, who are unable to complete the program, would have the
provision to change the program to Focus School Program, as an exit option.

Hence, a Focus School Program would also be approved along with an e-
Master program under the same title, which can also be offered independently

from time to time to other candidates.
5. Outcome
● The candidates enrolled in this programme would be considered regular
students of the institute. Accordingly, they would have access to all facilities
on campus including Laboratories, Library, Career Development Services,
Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center. They would also be granted an
Alumni status upon successful completion.
● The candidates successfully completing this program would be conferred an
e-Master’s degree (e.g. e-Master’s in Data Analytics, e-Master’s in Safety
Engineering)

● If a candidate plans to join another program at IITGN, during or after the e-
Masters, the credits earned by the candidate in all courses except the

foundational courses would be transferred.",

faculty members from the Institute and outside.
● The honorarium and/or coordination fees to the resource persons would
be paid as per the norms of IITGN-X. The coordinators can invite
resource persons (instructors and teaching associates) for conducting the
courses or sessions or for assisting in the same.
● The fees for each Focus School may be proposed by IITGN-X at the time
of offering it for approval by the Director.
● The courses offered by the institute in other programs may be extended
to Focus School students with prior permission on a case-to-case basis.
● While designing the program, the proposals should account for the target
audience and the interest group.",
29,NORMS FOR PhD PROGRAMME,Academic Affairs,PhD,"NORMS FOR PhD PROGRAMME

(As approved by Senate in its 18th meeting held on 25th September 2014, updated in the

24th/32nd/36th/39th/44th/60th/63rd/64th meetings of the Senate)

The fundamental mission of the PhD programme of IITGN is to foster creative and scholarly
inquiry while inculcating intellectual habits required for successful careers in teaching, research,
innovation and entrepreneurship. At its core, it is envisioned that an IITGN PhD degree will be a
very personal journey for the candidate, during which they undergo deep introspection and
mature both academically and personally. Without compromising on the above core ideals and
fundamental mission, the PhD programme at IITGN is expected to afford a great deal of flexibility
and independence while encouraging the various interdisciplinary interactions needed for
learning. The PhD programme is integral to IITGN's mission of furthering its status as a premier
research Institute, and PhD students form the backbone of the research being conducted at the
Institute. In short, by providing a dynamic learning experience, the PhD programme at IITGN is
meant to be an intellectually exciting journey that shapes students into creative thinkers.
The faculty of IITGN and their research endeavours are classified into faculty groups based on
somewhat common research themes. These groups will be formed by a sufficiently large group of
faculty members at IITGN based on their common/allied research interests and sufficient research
activity in the Institute to warrant designation as a faculty group. A faculty member can become a
member of more than one faculty group. The constitution of these faculty groups may dynamically
change with time as faculty research interests evolve. Admission into the PhD programme will be

coordinated through faculty groups who will assist the students in choosing the courses/project-
based independent study and lab rotation based on the student's interests and availability of

faculty resources. Even though the faculty groups are primarily responsible for determining and
supervising the student's coursework and research throughout the PhD programme, the students
are admitted to the Institute and NOT to the individual faculty groups/disciplines.
The highlights of IITGN's PhD programme can be summarized in three distinctways:
§ First, the programme facilitates exposure to diverse information and ideas to expand the
breadth of the student's knowledge.
§ Second, the programme will enable interaction and face-to-face professional learning
through collaboration with the faculty and peers.
§ Third, the programme is about a scholarly culture that encourages knowledge creation and
dissemination of research in a timely manner.
A. Role of Doctoral Studies Committee (DSC):
For each PhD student, a Doctoral Studies Committee (DSC) will be constituted, typically at the
end of the first semester of their registration in the PhD programme. The thesis supervisor will
be the convener of the committee and will recommend the constitution of the committee for
approval of the Dean of Academic Affairs. Besides the thesis supervisor(s), DSC will typically
have two or more faculty members, with at least one member from the same discipline and one
member from a different discipline. If the DSC consists of more than three faculty members, the
additional member(s) can be either from the same or different discipline/area of research. If
needed, the committee may include persons from outside the Institute. Inclusion of outside
members into DSC typically requires approval of the Chairman, Senate. Although the DSC will
carry out several assessments related to the course work and thesis work, its primary mandate

Academic Affairs Advisory 23 (May 2023)
)

Page 2
is to provide feedback to the student from time to time. Its members are expected to function
as a peer to the student rather than as an examiner.
B. Credit Requirements:
Students entering the programme will have to take total credits ranging from 88 through 120, out
of which coursework credits (typical course is of 4 credits) can range between 32 through 64,
depending upon the area of interest/discipline and the previous degree attained by the student. In
addition, all PhD students must complete the PG Orientation Programme Aarohan (2 credits) and two
courses of Physical Education (0 credits). For a detailed description of the minimum coursework and
research credits required, see the Table below.

Table 1 gives the minimum credit requirements through coursework and research for successfully
completing the PhD programme. However, meeting this minimum credit requirement will not lead
to a PhD degree.
(a) In exceptional situations, if an entering student has taken a substantially high number of
courses as part of their previous degrees, a waiver of up to 10 credits towards lowering
course requirements may be granted. The waiver may be recommended by the DSC and the
Dean of Academic Affairs and approved by the Chairman Senate.
(b) Completing PG Orientation Programme Aarohan (2 Credits) is a mandatory graduation
requirement for all PhD students. [Note: The two credits for Aarohan is in addition to the
minimum credit requirements mentioned in Table I].
§ Aarohan is a two-week long programme that all the newly joined students are
expected to successfully complete before they commence the first semester in their
academic programme. It would have 5 themes (Inventing and Discovering,
Communication, Professionalism and Ethics, Social Engagement, Well-being).
§ Students who graduate with an MTech/MSc/MA from IITGN and thereafter take
admission in the PhD programme may be exempted from attending the PG
Orientation Programme if they have already participated in the PG Orientation
Programme during their previous programme. Students under the PRL-IITGN PhD
programme are exempted from the Aarohan [Ref: Senate 2021.6.24].
§ Successful completion of the programme may be mandatory for release of fellowship
to the students.

Academic Affairs Advisory 23 (May 2023)
)

Page 3
§ In cases where a student fails to clear Aarohan, they must clear an additional two
credits worth of HSS courses for graduation (applicable for all students who join from
Semester – II, 2022-23 onwards) [Ref: Senate 2022.5.10].

(c) Students joining the PhD programme (from semester – I, 2021-22 onwards) must complete
two Physical Education (PE) courses, one each in their first two semesters, as part of their
graduation requirements. These courses will be evaluated on a Pass/No Pass grade basis.
(d) A 4-credit Writing course is required to be taken by all doctoral students. The requirement of
completing the Writing course is waived for PhD scholars who have completed
MTech/MSc/MA degree from IIT Gandhinagar [Ref: Senate 2023.2.10] [Note: The waiver of 4
credits will be in addition to credit waiver mentioned in section B(a)].
(e) Candidates pursuing their degree in Engineering and Natural Sciences must earn at least
four credits through HSS courses. Similarly, the candidates pursuing their degree in HSS
must earn at least four credits through Engineering and Natural Sciences courses.
[Note: The four credits of the HSS course requirement for candidates pursuing their degree in
Engineering and Natural Sciences is in addition to the Writing course.]
(f) PhD students may credit undergraduate courses (up to 5xx level) at IITGN. However, only
up to 8 credits of such courses can be counted towards the graduation requirement. In
addition, they may be allowed to count one UG course (up to 5xx level) of HSS towards their
graduation requirements [Ref: Senate 2016.2.22]. The DSC may set additional requirements for
courses over and above those in Table 1 based on the student's background. [Note: All other
courses must be at the postgraduate level, with a course code of 6XX or above.]
(g) Full-time Doctoral students should register for a minimum of 12 credits each semester.
Maximum registration in a semester can be up to 22 credits unless otherwise permitted for
higher credits without thesis registration by the Dean, Academic Affairs.
(h) Out of the minimum credits through coursework, a minimum of 12 credits must be completed
through project-based courses. Each unit of this project course will have three credits, and
four of such courses must be registered during the programme. Project-based courses may
include activities including lab-based experiments, independent study with a faculty, design
study, book review etc., that involve at least 100 hours of overall engagement for a 3-
credit course by the student in a given semester.
Note: For more details on project-based courses, refer to the advisory entitled ""Norms for IN
791: Independent Research Project, IN 792: Independent Research Seminar and IN 798:
Seminar Course"".
(i) In addition, a student can earn proficiency credits by engaging in any of the approved
activities. These credits are typically earned in later stages of the PhD programme (after the
qualifying examination). Such credits will be mentioned in the student's transcript; however,
these will not be counted towards graduation requirements. A student should generally earn
at least six such credits before graduation.
(j) The DSC may set additional course requirements for a candidate whose research is in an
area significantly different from the background in their past qualifying degrees.
(k) All doctoral students must comply with two calendar years of the minimum residency
requirement.

Academic Affairs Advisory 23 (May 2023)

Page 4
(l) In addition to the above credit requirements, every student will have to register for one credit
of seminar attendance every semester, expecting them to attend on an average one
seminar per week from across the Institute. Based on the student's consistent
attendance, Pass (P)/Fail (F) grades will be awarded by the advisor. However, this additional
credit will not be counted toward the total credit requirement for graduation.

C. Academic Performance Requirements (For students admitted from AY 2023-24)
[Ref: Senate 2022.5.10]
(a) The minimum CPI for graduation is 6.5 out of 10.
(b) There will be no maximum permissible duration to complete the requirements of the
programme. However, at any time, credits earned older than eight years will be deemed
expired and will not count towards the graduation requirements. After 13 semesters, a
request from the student is needed to extend the programme on a semester by semester
basis. [Note: Course credits as well as research credits earned older than eight years will be
deemed expired]
(c) The thesis units registered by a student will be graded using letter grades A, B, C and F,
where A, B and C are passing grades and F is a fail grade. A student may register for one 4
credit thesis unit or a multiples of it and can be graded according to the number of units which
they have registered for. The thesis grades will not be counted towards the CPI calculation.
[Note: All thesis grades will be included in the transcript/grade report]
(d) If the student accumulates F grades in more than 24 credits of thesis units any time
during their PhD programme, the student will have to exit the programme.
(e) In case the CPI of a student falls below 6.0 out of 10, the fellowship provided, if any, by the
Institute will be stopped immediately and for the future.
(f) Sections C(a) to C(e) are applicable only for students admitted from academic year 2023-24.

Academic Affairs Advisory 23 (May 2023)
)

Page 5
Students from previous batches may also opt for these instead of sections D(a) to D(d).
(g) The student must successfully clear the Qualifying Examination (preferably within three
semesters and no later than two years from joining in exceptional circumstances). The
admission will be terminated if the student fails to do so.
(h) All PhD students must give a Proposal Defense Seminar within four months of
successfully clearing the Qualifying examination.
D. Academic Performance Requirements (For students admitted before AY 2023-24)
(a) The minimum CPI for graduation is 6.5 out of 10.
(b) The maximum duration of the PhD programme will be 7 years and 6 years for students who
joined the PhD programme with a qualifying degree type I or II and III (as per Table 1)
respectively.
(c) The minimum CPI for continuing the programme at any point is 6.0 out of 10. That is, if,
at any stage, the student has a CPI less than 6.0, the programme will be terminated.
(d) In case the CPI of a student falls below 6.5 out of 10, or the student accumulates eight or
more Us towards thesis grades, the fellowship provided by the Institute will be stopped
permanently. The student may seek financial support from projects or other Institute
activities through individual effort. In exceptional cases, the continuation of the fellowship may
be approved by the Director on the recommendation of the Dean, Academic Affairs.
(e) Sections C(a) to C(e) are applicable only for students admitted from academic year 2023-24.
However, students from previous batches may also opt for these instead of sections D(a) to
D(d). [Note: A request for this change may be sent to the academic office for processing and
approval.]
(f) The student must successfully clear the Qualifying Examination (preferably within three
semesters and no later than two years from joining in exceptional circumstances). The
admission will be terminated if the student fails to do so.
(g) All PhD students must give a Proposal Defense Seminar within four months of
successfully clearing the Qualifying examination.
E. Thesis Submission and Fellowship:
(a) The expected time of thesis submission for ALL the PhD students (with qualifying degree
I/II/III) is five years or less.
(b) Students will not receive financial assistance from the Institute after their expected tenure
(currently five years). However, the student's supervisor may pay the student from their
projects if it is justified.
(c) Full-time PhD students who submit their thesis within their regular fellowship period may
continue availing full fellowship till the date of their thesis defense, OR till the completion of
their regular fellowship period of 5 years, whichever is earlier [Ref: Senate 2018.3.17]. [Note: This
continuation of fellowship will be approved by the Dean, Academic Affairs, on the request of
the student and recommendation of the PhD Thesis Supervisor. The student will be required

Academic Affairs Advisory 23 (May 2023)
)

Page 6
to work from the campus and will also be required to perform TA duties similar to that of
regular PhD students]
(d) If the PhD defense of a student is conducted well within the expected period of submission,
the student may be recommended for a postdoctoral position (till they complete five years)
based on the evaluation of review comments on the thesis and recommendation submitted by
the supervisor.
F. Proficiency Credits:
Proficiency credits are associated with professional/research-based activities that PhD students
may undertake during their doctoral programme and are optional in nature. These proficiency
credits can be earned by engaging in any combination of the approved activities indicated below.
Since these credits are optional, at the end of each semester, students should submit a summary
report describing the activities undertaken. The DSC will review the summary report and
recommend credits to be awarded to such activities after taking into account the nature of the
activity, time investment of the student and proficiency involved in the activity. Each credit will be
assessed based on a minimum of 40 hours of time involvement in the activity. Total
activities/credits accumulated through this process during the entire doctoral programme will be
indicated on the final transcript of the student. Dean/ Associate Dean of Academic Affairs (or a
nominee of the Dean) will review the recommendation of DSC and approve the same, if in order.
Examples of approved activities that fetch proficiency credits include:
§ Playing a pivotal role in guiding BTech projects (along with faculty advisor of BTech project)
§ Organizing speaker series
§ Assisting faculty/staff in organizing technical symposia, industry workshops, etc.
§ Teaching duties that go beyond teaching assistant responsibilities, for example, an initiative
in developing and teaching a new course
§ Assisting in writing grant proposals
The activities listed above are immensely beneficial for the holistic growth of a student. However,
it is also recognized that imposing such activities in the form of compulsory credit-bearing
modules may not be entirely desirable. The above endeavours are such that any form of forced
compliance will stifle their cultural acceptance as value-adding activities. Any work towards thesis
research will NOT be counted as Proficiency Credits. Any work which is part of a duty or a source
of earning, such as the work related to Teaching Assistantship or part-time appointment, will not
be counted towards Proficiency Credits. The Proficiency credits will be mentioned in the Grade
Card as and when those are earned by the student with appropriate approvals. One of the
following texts will be used to show these credits, as applicable on case to case basis:
§ Proficiency credits for teaching activity
§ Proficiency credits for research activity
§ Proficiency credits for academic leadership
§ Proficiency credits for a scholarly initiative
G. A measure of Quality of PhD Candidates and Approach to Assess Thesis Progress:
The students are expected to be active in both academic and non-academic learning aspects of
their education. Their progress in thesis work will be reviewed by the DSC by looking at their:

Academic Affairs Advisory 23 (May 2023)
)

Page 7

§ Focus on the research plan and graduation timeline
§ Amount of research done and whether the progress has been commensurate with the time
spent
§ Independent initiatives in research progress
§ Consistency of publishing
Besides these measures, the quality of a PhD candidate will be assessed through their overall
engagement during their stay. Some of the indicators of student engagement are listed below.
§ Performance in courses in the core area and outside
§ Participation in conferences and workshops
§ Regularly attending various talks and seminars
§ Active involvement in teaching with good feedback
§ Involvement in Institute activities
§ Helping other students in their projects and/or research
§ Attentiveness to TA work and other such assignments
§ Rapport with supervisor and other faculty members
§ Networking with the industry and other academic institutes
H. Milestones in the PhD Programme:
There will be periodic progress review meetings of the doctoral candidates with the DSC. DSC
approval will also be required for the following events:
§ Qualifying Examination
§ Proposal Defense
§ End of coursework (minimum coursework requirement has to be completed at this stage)
§ Thesis Seminar
§ Approval for thesis submission and, if applicable, recommendation on waiver of external
review
(a) DSC Seminar: PhD students who have completed two semesters at the Institute must present
their research work in a seminar to their DSC every semester. The seminar must be
conducted before 31st January for the July-December semester and 31st August for the
January-April semester and the Summer term.
Students will submit a self-assessment form before their DSC presentation. The
supervisor and DSC members will evaluate the report. The DSC members must provide their
comments on the prescribed form before submission to the academic office. Additionally,
discipline coordinators will submit a status report of the DSC presentations of all PhD students
in their discipline to the academic office each semester.
(b) Qualifying Examination: It is important to ensure the suitability of PhD students to carry out
rigorous research work during their programme, and those not meeting the minimum
expectations must be allowed to exit early. The qualifying examination is to be conducted
within three semesters. Under exceptional circumstances, students may be permitted to
appear for the qualifying examination afterwards but within two years with prior approval of the
Dean, Academic Affairs. In rare cases, the candidate may be given a re-examination by
allowing them 90 to 150 days of preparation. The examination will ensure the breadth and
understanding of fundamentals (that is, course work before and during studies at IITGN)
through a written examination and aptitude for research and appreciation of the area of

Academic Affairs Advisory 23 (May 2023)
)

Page 8

research (through an oral examination).
(c) Proposal Defense: All doctoral students must give a proposal defense seminar within four
months of successfully clearing the qualifying examination. The Proposal Defense will
include both a written report and a presentation. Individual disciplines/faculty groups will be
free to decide the specifics of the report and presentation depending upon the discipline's need
and the student's proposed thesis project. This will, however, be conducted by the DSC, and
the DSC may not clear the student until it is satisfied, requiring the student to go through the
same more than once. DSC will communicate to the Academic Office once it clears the
student's proposal defense.
(d) Thesis Seminar: Doctoral students will give a Thesis Seminar towards the end of their thesis work
when they are almost ready for thesis submission. Through this seminar, the student is expected
to take feedback on their research from a wider audience. The DSC will have a follow-up meeting
with the student to form its recommendation about thesis submission. The student will fill up a form
indicating that they have successfully completed all the coursework requirements. The DSC may
decide not to recommend thesis submission and ask the student to work more. In case the thesis
work is found satisfactory, and the required course work has been completed, the DSC may allow
the student to submit the thesis and accordingly report to the Dean, AcademicAffairs.
(e) Thesis Submission for Review and Waiver of External Review: Once the DSC allows for
thesis submission, the student can also submit a request to the DSC regarding waiver of
external review based on the peer review already completed for a substantial part of the
work through publications. To make this claim, the student must provide adequate evidence of
research activity in terms of peer-reviewed research publications or notifications, conference
submissions/ presentations, peer review comments, etc. The DSC can assess the claim of the
student and decide not to recommend a waiver. In case the DSC finds the claim satisfactory,
the DSC's recommendation on the waiver, along with all the supporting documents, will be sent
to the Chairman, Senate, through the Dean of Academic Affairs for consideration and approval.
In case the waiver is not granted, the student will submit a synopsis of the thesis, and the
supervisor will provide the names of possible external reviewers – at least five from within
India and at least five from outside India. The Chairman Senate will mark three external
reviewers from the list suggested by the supervisor or from outside that list. The reviewers will
be contacted for their consent to review the thesis based on the content of the synopsis, and
the process will be administered through the Academic Office. When the student submits the
thesis, it will be sent to the three external reviewers approved by the Chairman, Senate. Once
the feedback is received from all the reviewers, the student will prepare a detailed rebuttal to
the reviewer's comments and suitably incorporate corrections in the thesis to the satisfaction of
the supervisor before proceeding to the final thesis defense.
The students who have demonstrated adequate peer review material (e.g. published works,
peer-reviewed conference presentations/proceedings, etc.) can be granted a waiver from the
external review process by the Chairman, Senate based on the recommendations of the DSC
and the Dean, Academic Affairs. In this case, the student can directly proceed to the process of
final defense after submitting the thesis.
(f) Final Thesis Defense: Once the student is ready for final defense, the supervisor will provide
five names in addition to the DSC members, along with a request to form a Final Defense
Committee (FDC) for the student. The Chairman Senate will form the FDC on the
recommendation of the Dean of Academic Affairs, which will typically have 5-6 persons,
including the supervisor as the convener. Unless there is a reason, the DSC members will also
be members of the FDC. In case of external review, the student is expected to submit the

Academic Affairs Advisory 23 (May 2023)
)

Page 9
corrected thesis along with the rebuttal sheets to the FDC at least one week before
the date of the final thesis defense. The final thesis defense must be conducted within six
months from the date of receiving all the reviewer's comments unless permission has been
sought from the Dean of Academic Affairs for an extension.
In case of waiver from external review, the final thesis defense can be scheduled any time two
weeks after the date of thesis submission. The final defense must be conducted within three
months of thesis submission unless permission has been sought from the Dean of Academic
Affairs for an extension.
The purpose of the Final Defense is to allow the FDC to evaluate the research activity of the
doctoral student. The overall assessment of the thesis will be marked by the FDC (in a Likert
scale with categories ranging from outstanding, very good, good, average, and below average)
along with its recommendation in a report to be submitted to the Academic office for final
approval by the Chairman, Senate. The FDC can make any additional suggestions and require
changes in the thesis before making a final recommendation.
(g) Final Thesis Submission: Upon successful thesis defense and based on the FDC's
recommendation, the candidate will submit the final thesis in the prescribed format to the
Institute within 90 days of defense unless an extension has been granted by Dean, Academic
Affairs. One printed copy of the thesis has to be submitted to the Library, and the soft copy has
to be submitted to the Academic Office (email to phdthesis@iitgn.ac.in). The student is not
required to be in residency after the thesis submission for review. The recommendation of the
final thesis submission will be submitted to the Chairman, Senate, for approval.

(As approved by the Senate in its 18th meeting held on 25th September 2014)

The Continuing Doctoral Programme (previously known as the External and FDP categories) is
meant for candidates who given their family or professional constraints are unable to pursue the
regular or standard doctoral programme offered by IITGN. In order to facilitate advanced educational
opportunities for such candidates, IITGN will provide an opportunity of “advance admission” with one
year of preparatory period; but once admitted they are required to follow the overall requirements of
the regular Ph.D programme. The key features of the Continuing Doctoral Programme are listed
below:
· It is envisaged that not more than 20 percent of the total Ph.D degrees offered by IITGN will
be comprised of such non-regular Ph.D candidates.
· Applications should be sponsored and financially supported by their parent
organizations/institutions. The parent organization/institutions should also preferably make
provisions for activities such as travel to and participation in conferences. No
scholarship/fellowship will be paid by IIT Gandhinagar.
· The selected candidate should be available for a preparatory phase [extending over one year]
during which they will spend a minimum of 90 days at the Institute in pursuit of background
preparation, outlining of research proposal, literature review, fulfilling communication skills
requirements etc.
· No tuition fees will be charged during the preparatory phase. Candidates will be required to
pay other prescribed levies and deposits.
· On successful completion of preparatory phase, the candidates will be formally enrolled for the
Ph.D programme for which they will have to pay the prescribed tuition and other fees.
· Such candidates are expected to complete the coursework early on in the doctoral
programme.
· For all candidates through CDP, minimum two years of residency is required, preferably before
the proposal defense. In addition, the CDP programme also requires at least 2 weeks of
residency at the Institute during each semester all through the Ph.D programme, unless it is
waived in a semester by the Dean, Academic Affairs for genuine reasons.
· Candidates should be released by their parent organization/institutions for a minimum of two
years full time study and research at IIT Gandhinagar. Subsequently, assessment of the
candidate will be made by the Doctoral Studies Committee (DSC). If the candidate is deemed to
have made substantial progress in his/her research and that there is a reasonable chance that
the remaining work can be done by him/her in the parent organization/institution to fulfill the
requirements for submission of the Ph.D thesis, candidates may be permitted to rejoin their
parent organizations / institutions.
· IITGN does not require these non-regular candidates to have an advisor at their home
institute/university/research lab/company. In case there is a co-advisor or mentor from the
parent organization, he/she can also be included in the DSC of that student.
All candidates admitted under this special scheme would be governed by all rules and regulations of
IITGN, inclusive of conformity with the prescribed ethical norms. In some instances, the parent
organization/institute may not be in a position to financially support the candidate(s) and the
candidate(s) may be utilizing his/her/their earned / half-pay leave etc., IIT Gandhinagar may at its
discretion give suitable waiver to related requirements.",

CANDIDATES WITHOUTREQUIREMENT OF GATE/CSIR
(Updated in the 33rd Senate meeting held on 22nd November 2018 and approved by
the BoG in its 25th Meeting held on 3rd December 2018)

The Institute has been making continuous efforts to attract excellent students to its PhD
program. Accordingly, a scheme where top-quality students who do not have a valid GATE,
NET or equivalent exam qualification, but are shortlisted after a rigorous selection process by
the Institute, was approved by the Board of Governors in its 13th meeting held on 14th March
2014. Students admitted to the Institute without having qualified the GATE/NET/equivalent
exam have typically been paid fellowship from the Excellence funds of the Institute at a rate
similar to regular Ph.D. scholars.
The PhD program has now stabilized and students supported through Excellence funds need to
be shifted to MHRD funds. Therefore:
1. The number of students without a GATE/NET/equivalent national exam admitted in each
academic year be limited to less than 25% of the total number of career faculty members
at the beginning of that academic year.
2. These students will receive fellowship from Excellence funds at a rate similar to the
regular Institute fellowship during their first year. During this time, students will be
expected to obtain GATE/NET, etc. qualification, as applicable.
3. If a student fails to qualify the applicable national level exam, the fellowship will be
reduced to 75% of the regular fellowship amount for the second year, and 50% in the
third year and beyond.
4. The fellowship will be paid for a maximum of 5 years. No fellowship will be given after 5
years in the program.
5. If a student qualifies GATE/NET, etc. at any point, he/she will be provided fellowship
from MHRD funds at the regular rate from date of announcement of GATE/NET results.
6. If a student obtains CSIR-JRF or some other equivalent fellowship at any point, he/she
will receive that fellowship from the earliest applicable date.
7. Upon qualification of the applicable exam, the student will also become eligible for
Institute support beyond the 5th year (at a reduced rate) similar to regular PhD students.
This will be applicable for all students admitted in and after Semester 1, 2018-19. For students
who joined prior to this time, the Chairman, Senate upon recommendation of the Dean,

Academic Affairs, may decide on the continuation of the fellowship and the amount on a case-
to-case basis.

This will not be applicable to students admitted via the Start Early PhD program.",

FOR PH.D STUDENTS",Academic Affairs,PhD,"NORMS ON OVERSEAS RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

FOR PH.D STUDENTS

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 9th meeting held on 28th March 2013)
The Institute is committed to have a rigorous PhD programme for preparing outstanding
academic leaders and researchers. Efforts are being made to attract the best talent in the
country to join the Institute’s PhD programme and to provide the best possible learning
environment and research experience to them. As part of these efforts, it is envisioned that
an exposure to some of the state-of-the-art research facilities and interaction with prominent
researchers overseas will widen the perspective of these students and give a tremendous
boost to their confidence level. It is also imperative that such a research experience be for a
significant duration so that the students can get some tangible outputs from their visit
overseas.
The following norms have been arrived at with the above context in mind. It is understood
that these norms will be reviewed and revised periodically to meet the needs of changed
circumstances as the Institute grows and as the experience is gained on implementation of
this scheme.
1. Full-time PhD students who have successfully completed their requirements of
qualifying examination are eligible for financial assistance to go for overseas
research experience. The applicant is expected to have an excellent academic
performance and impeccable record of interpersonal relations. The student, with help
from the supervisor(s), should establish contact with the overseas collaborator to
layout the research objectives and seek a written consent from the host professor.
2. This scheme will provide support to a student only once during his/her entire PhD
programme for a duration of the overseas visit being approximately one semester (4
– 6 months).
3. This financial assistance can support the expenses related to visas, air travel
(including local travel within the foreign country for attending any conferences),
health insurance during the visit, and a lump-sum maintenance allowance to support
accommodation and boarding (food) expenses. The lump-sum maintenance
allowance payable to the student during the visit will be US$ 500 per week for US/
Canada/ Europe/ Japan/ New Zealand/ Australia and US$ 300 per week for the other
countries. The dates of travel will be included in counting the number of weeks.
4. The amount to be provided by way of financial support will be subject to an overall
ceiling of US$ 12,500 per student.
5. A committee comprising Dean (Academic Affairs), Dean (Research and
Development), and Dean (Student Affairs) may consider applications
supported/endorsed by faculty supervisor(s) and make appropriate recommendations
to the Director for approval.

Academic Affairs Advisory 15 (Version 3.0, January 2014) Page 2
6. A recipient of this support may seek additional support from other sources including
the organization of intended visit overseas, and/or, meet a part of the expenditure
through personal finances/loans. The concerned faculty supervisors may also
consider supporting the students partially through their own projects or professional
development accounts.
7. The student will be treated to be on academic leave during such a visit. Hence, the
student will register at the Institute for the semester(s) and continue to draw
scholarship. Thesis grade submission and other such administrative requirements
will be taken care of by the supervisor(s) based on the feedback from the overseas
professor.
8. In case a student decides to do academic registration at the overseas
university/institute, he/she may request the Institute for transfer of credits in lieu
thereof. However, the Institute will not pay any fees or charges to the host
university/institute.
9. Expenditure on this scheme will be covered from the “Excellence Funds” as
approved by the Board of Governors from time to time, such as donations, interest
income of the endowment, and overheads and savings of the projects.
Above norms do not necessarily mean that the Institute is committed to providing full
funding for students. The Institute may set a lower limit for funding or provide partial
financial support on a case to case basis.",

OTHER TOP UG PROGRAMMES IN INDIA (START EARLY PH.D)",Academic Affairs,PhD,"IIT GN PhD FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMME FOR B.TECHS OF THE IITs AND
OTHER TOP UG PROGRAMMES IN INDIA (START EARLY PH.D)
(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 5th meeting held on 14TH December 2011
and later modified by Senate in its 15th Meeting held on 03rd January 2014)
Background:

1. The Kakodkar Committee, looking into functioning of the IITs, has strongly
recommended that a) IITs must significantly increase the number of PhD students,
and b) IITs must make extra efforts to bring the BTechs of the IIT system into the
PhD programme.
2. The objective of this programme is to attract those holding B.Tech degree from the
IIT system as well as those from other top undergraduate colleges in the country to
our PhD program.
3. Under this programme direct admission into our PhD programme may be offered to
a. BTech graduates of the IIT system regardless of whether they have
qualified GATE or other national level examination but have a CPI of not
less than 6.0 at the end of their third year.
b. Top three rankers in different branches of BTech programme in selected 70
engineering colleges in the country PLUS all the NITs. The admission will
be based on the academic performance at the end of third year.
4. The admission offer will be made when the students are in their final year of
BTech, perhaps before they go through their placement season.
5. The selected candidates will have to fulfill the eligibility criteria at the end of
the BTech in terms of percentage of marks etc. and will join the Institute as a
PhD student upon completion of their BTech degree requirements.
6. There will be no requirement of passing GATE examination for admission for
these candidates. However, there will be a differential for the financial support for
such candidates as outlined below.
7. All candidates admitted under this programme will be offered the regular PhD
fellowship and will be required to contribute the usual 8 hours / week of time
towards academic assistance.

Academic Affairs Advisory 20 (Version 3.0, August 2019) Page 1

8. Those students, admitted through this programme, who have qualified GATE or
qualify GATE during their studies at IITGN, will receive in addition to the full
fellowship, an additional fellowship of Rs 10,000 per month from the donations,
subject to (a) they contributing an additional 4 hours per week in teaching activities of
the Institute, (b) availability of donation funds, and (c) satisfactory academic
performance of the student. This additional fellowship will be renewed every year
based on academic performance and contribution to the teaching programme.
Further, the additional Fellowship will be provided for not more than 36 months.
9. Department of Science and Technology (DST) has recently started a program called
INSPIRE (Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research). In this program DST
gives fellowship (for 5 years) to 1st rank holders of graduate/post graduate programs
to do PhD at IITs. If any such student joins IITGN, the Institute will provide an
additional fellowship of Rs 10,000/- per month additional fellowship from the
donations subject to (a) the student contributing an additional 4 hours per week in
teaching activities of the Institute, (b) availability of donation funds, and (c)
satisfactory performance of the student.
10. Every year, the Institute will send a communication to all the concerned institutes
with requests to advertise the publicity materials, and to encourage their students to
apply to IITGN.
11. The students short-listed by the concerned faculty members at IITGN will be invited
by the Institute for a visit and an interview before they are offered the admission.
They will be paid their travel expenses by the Institute for this visit.
12. The students offered admission through this programme will be asked to send an
acceptance letter and deposit the fees.
13. For this scheme to work well, it is important that IITGN must engage the colleges (in
addition to the IITs and NITs) in a number of collaborative activities and not just look
at them as source for students. Hence, IITGN will engage maximum possible
colleges covered under this programme through:
a. Summer internship opportunities to their undergraduate students
b. Summer Research Opportunity to their faculty members.
c. Joint academic and research activities with their faculty members.
d. Enabling the students of such colleges to come for laboratory usage
e. Visit of IITGN faculty for lectures and mentoring of students in these colleges.",

IN 798: SEMINAR COURSE",Academic Affairs,PhD,"NORMS FOR IN 791: INDEPENDENT RESEARCH PROJECT,
IN 792: INDEPENDENT RESEARCH SEMINAR AND

IN 798: SEMINAR COURSE

IN791/IN792 courses carry 3 credits, with an expectation of about 100 hours of overall
engagement. Each PhD student admitted in July 2013 and after needs to finish 12 credits (4
units) of IN791/IN792 courses before graduation.
● IN 791 is an activity oriented course where students need to perform one or more of
the followings: experimental work, simulations, coding, analysis, design, data
collection and interpretation, structured laboratory sessions, etc.
● IN 792 is a seminar course based on detailed Literature Review in the chosen topic
of the course, which may include reading books, journal articles, conference
proceedings, reports, etc.
The focus and objective of IN791/IN792 courses for PhD scholars is to promote the
following:
1. Provide breadth to knowledge base and capability to understand variety of topics
beyond their thesis topic as well as exploring different areas beyond their
specialization. Promoting students to come out from their comfort zone and explore
something different.
2. Working with various faculty members during these courses gives a broader
spectrum to their personality as a more rounded professional. For example: a Civil
Engineering student in Geotechnical Engineering research area does one IN course
in mathematical type problem (structures) in one semester, and then explores
composite materials (in Mechanical Engineering) in other semester with another
faculty member.
3. In spirit, it is an attempt to expose the student to various dimensions (different topics,
different sub-streams, different disciplines, different professors, different methods of
learning including project based and literature review based). The take-home from
these courses will surely be significantly different from one student to another, based
on his/her capability to allow himself/herself to flow in new content without the fear of
moving from his/her comfort zone.
Course Work Expectations:
● Each unit (3 credits) will require about 100-120 hours of overall engagement in a
semester, which includes meeting, reading, preparations, report writing, etc.
● A student can register for maximum one unit (3 credits) of IN792 Independent
research seminar in a semester. IN791 Independent research project can be
registered for any number of units (3, 6, 9, etc) in a semester, irrespective of IN792
registration.
● It is NOT necessary to work on an innovative topic with tangible outcomes or create
new knowledge. Learning from existing knowledge or performing repeat analysis and

Academic Affairs Advisory 26 (Version 1.0, August 2014)Page 2
design is perfectly fine. It is fine to work on writing skills and presentation skills by
following an old series of work, gain hands-on experience through a set of
experiments, learn new skills like machining, instrumentation, creating surveys,
sampling, etc.
● The topic chosen in IN791/IN792 course should not be part of thesis work in any
manner. In case of any overlap with thesis work in future, the student is expected to
submit request for dropping these credits by submitting a detailed explanation.
● For example, in one unit of IN792 it is sufficient for a student to read 8-12 journal
articles related to the topic and summarize those with their own interpretations and
good understanding. Similarly, one can scale the expectations in IN791 project work.
Course Adviser:
● The students should choose course advisor in the area of their interest in
consultation with the programme advisor. It is suggested to be with different faculty
advisers on different topics each time, but not necessary.
● The students should work with at least one course advisor who is not from the
primary area of their thesis work.
● A students should NOT have the same course adviser for more than TWO out of the
required FOUR units of these courses.
● The students should meet and choose course advisor for each unit within first week
of the semester and submit the name(s) to the course coordinator of their own
discipline.

Evaluation:
● The students are expected to work on IN791/IN792 throughout the semester by
distributing their work on weekly basis. The assessment will be primarily based on
the amount and consistency of effort.
● The students are expected to present their work at least two times in a semester in
front of an evaluation committee or a faculty group, one in the middle of the semester
and the other towards the end of the semester.
● The course coordinator of the discipline will finalize grade(s) of each student in
consultation with the committee/group and the course advisor(s) of the student and
submit it to the academic office before end-semester examination.

Academic Affairs Advisory 26 (Version 1.0, August 2014)Page 3
IN 798: Seminar Course

The PhD students, July 2013 batch onwards, are registered for one-credit seminar course in
each semester. It is different from the 3-credit course IN792 Independent research seminar.
● The expectation of IN798 is that each student will attend at least one seminar/lecture
per week on an average, i.e., 15 hours of such sessions.
● It includes faculty candidate seminars (of any discipline), invited lectures in discipline
or outside, lectures/seminars outside the institute, popular lectures, interaction
sessions with invited speakers, student seminars, etc.
● At the end of the semester, the registered students fill up a claim form with details of
the attended seminar/lectures, which requires minimum 15 hours worth of genuine
entries to get Pass grade. Hence, The students are advised to keep track of the
attended seminars.",

(As approved by Senate in its 18

th meeting held on 3

rd January 2014 and 30th meeting held on

17th April 2018)

IITGN has taken forceful initiatives to attract and recruit only the best scholars to its PhD programme.
The institute places special emphasis on the academic background and credentials of its doctoral
scholars. In an effort to maintain high standards of PhD recruitment, the institute intends to develop
stronger relationships with the alma mater institutions of its current doctoral students. A scheme to
support the interaction of current doctoral students with their undergraduate or postgraduate
institutions is hereby proposed. Details and provisions of this scheme are as follows:
1. Current PhD students of the Institution in the Regular category will be encouraged to visit their
parent undergraduate and/or postgraduate institutions.
2. IITGN will support the to and fro travel of doctoral students to their undergraduate and/or
postgraduate institutions by IInd AC. The institute will also cover hospitality including boarding and
lodging at their place of visit as per prescribed norms of the institute.
3. Doctoral students who are interested in availing of this scheme are required to apply in the
prescribed format to the Academic Office. The Academic Office will coordinate with the Discipline
Coordinator of the student's discipline to formalize activities planned during the student's visit.
Student's may be required to make a presentation, interact with current students of their parent
institutions and engage the faculty of those institutions.
4. The student's visit is expected to enthuse their parent institutions with the culture, aspirations and
achievements of IITGN. Doctoral students who avail of this scheme will be required to submit a
report in prescribed format to the Academic Office upon completion of their visit. The Academic
Office may also engage with the institutions visited to collect and compile feedback regarding
information provided about llTGN.
The proposed scheme of supporting doctoral students of IITGN towards visiting their alma mater
institutions is an innovative and aggressive effort by the institute to develop strong relationships with
numerous institutions that have and will likely continue to provide a valuable pool of doctoral students.",
36,"NORMS FOR ENGAGING PH.D. STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC
ACTIVITIES",Academic Affairs,PhD,"NORMS FOR ENGAGING PH.D. STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC

ACTIVITIES

(as approved by the Senate on 25 September 2014 and amended by the

Senate in its 32nd meeting)

The doctoral programme of the Institute places a large emphasis on holistic
development of the students with leadership skills for their future endeavors.
Besides the expectation of in-depth work in thesis work, the new PhD Curriculum expects
the students to attend seminars, organize conferences, write research grant
proposals and participate in Institute activities. It is expected that active participation
of the students in teaching and coordination of activities with mentorship of faculty
members of the Institute can be useful in developing their teaching and leadership
skills. For example, teaching (lecturing and/or tutoring) a course as an independent
instructor is a completely different experience than helping an instructor in a course
as a teaching assistant or as a grader. Similarly, taking the responsibility of
coordinating with visitors of the institute can be a significant learning experience. It
can be a matter of pride for the student to independently carry out such a responsibility,
which will help them build their confidence besides sharpening their people skills and learning
about work ethics.
Currently, all Ph.D students receiving Institute Fellowship are expected to devote
eight hours per week for assistance in teaching and other academic activities.
Further, those receiving top-up fellowships are expected to devote four more
hours for such activities. It may be worthwhile to leverage this time more effectively.
It is proposed to institutionalize a few of major activities of the Institute besides
teaching opportunities which can be offered to the PhD students from time to time
through a careful selection process. These positions will have well-defined scope
of work and a fixed tenure. To begin with the following two positions are proposed to
be created with immediate effect:
a) Graduate Teaching Fellow (GTF): This position will have tenure of six
months at a time. The student selected for this position will have the responsibility
of teaching a course independently as an instructor or tutor of the course,
like any other faculty member involved in such a course.
b) Graduate Institute Fellow (GIF): This position will have tenure of one
year or six months which can be renewed based on the performance. The

Academic Affairs Advisory 41(Version 1.1, March 2019) Page 2
student selected for this position will have independent charge of coordinating a
set of significant activities of the Institute. For example: to help for arranging
industry trips of the UG and PG students, to help developing industry relations, to
help coordinate for international internships of the students, help in organizing
conferences, short courses, summer courses, editorial assistance, assistance in faculty
recruitment work, help in coordinating with visiting professors, data centre activities, etc.
The following norms are applicable regarding these graduate positions:
1) Number of positions will be approved by the Director based on the recommendation from
Dean of Academic Affairs. The proposal may come from various disciplines or
administrative sections through proper channel.
2) A student who has spent at least one year into the programme can apply for such
positions with consent from the supervisor. The Dean, Academic Affairs may device
suitable mechanism to select candidates for recommending the case to the Director for
approval.

3) In case student is an instructor of a course and is delivering independent lectures, a one-
time honorarium at the rate of Rs.5000/- per credit may be paid on satisfactory conduct

of the course. The amount may be pro-rated in case the course is shared etc. A few
occasional lectures by Ph.D students will not qualify for the honorarium.
4) Each student in such a position will have a mentor faculty member who will be also
responsible for providing sufficient training to the student for efficiently performing the
assigned work.
5) The appointment may be terminated at any time if the academic performance or work
ethics are found to be below expectations.
6) An experience certificate will be issued to the student by the Dean (Academic Affairs).

Outstanding Graduate Teaching Fellow Award

Training in the doctoral programme at IIT Gandhinagar is geared towards holistic development of
the Ph.D. students, with the expectation that these students will graduate to become exceptional
scientists and teachers in the best institutes worldwide. The Graduate Teaching Fellowships
(GTF) were created at the Institute with this broader goal in mind, and are meant to act as a
vehicle to provide Ph.D. students an opportunity to develop and enhance their teaching skills by
gaining the experience of teaching courses independently as instructors or tutors. This Fellowship
has been extremely well received, and a number of Ph.D. students have been selected for the
GTF via a careful and competitive selection process.

Academic Affairs Advisory 41(Version 1.1, March 2019) Page 3
Exceptional performance of the Fellows are recognized via “Outstanding Graduate Teaching
Fellow Award”. It is envisioned that such an award will boost the morale of the Ph.D. students,
and encourage more students to avail the GTF. Typically, one such award is given each semester.
The awardee gets a grant of up to Rs. 20,000 for travel and professional activities from the
Excellence Fund in the Endowment Account.
The required information may be as follows:
1. Nomination Letter: Any person can nominate the GTF for the award. Self-nominations may
also be accepted. This nomination may be a 1 page letter (maximum) and may comment on
the Fellow’s efforts and dedication towards teaching the course, preparation for the classes,
clarity of the material presented, ability to engage with the students, etc.
2. Teaching Statement from Fellow: The Fellow must submit a one page (maximum) letter
outlining the teaching philosophy he/she adopted in the course, whether and how the
prescribed goals were met, how he/she benefitted from the experience and what he/she would
do differently should a similar opportunity be available in the future.
3. Student Feedback: Brief statements from at least two students who studied under the Fellow
in the course. The nominee should not have access to these letters.
4. Course Reaction Survey summary: This may be provided by the Academic office.
Selection and Approval
A committee comprising of the Dean (Academics), Associate Dean (PG) and at least two other
faculty members will screen the nominations received. If required, brief interviews with all or a few
shortlisted nominees may be conducted. This committee will then select one Fellow for the award
and recommend to the Director for approval.",
37,NORMS FOR CERTIFICATION IN SCIENTIFIC WRITING,Academic Affairs,PhD,"NORMS FOR CERTIFICATION IN SCIENTIFIC WRITING
(As approved by the Senate in its 44th meeting held on 08 July 2020)
Exceptional research programs all over the world have integrated training and
certification in scientific writing in their institutional framework. A significant number of
Master’s and Doctoral students at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar
(IITGN) have limited experience in communicating research. In most cases, the first
conference poster or journal paper that emerges from a research scholar’s work at
IITGN is also their first successful scientific communication.
This certification in Scientific Writing is expected to:

• Encourage research scholars to work on scientific writing from an
early stage in their tenure
• Serve as a milestone for measuring student progress
• Facilitate emergence of tutors in scientific writing
• Contribute to skill building of IITGN students
• Enable students to use scientific writing competencies during their
life-long learning process.

Certification in Scientific Writing is not a training program. Its main goals are to gauge
students' skills and knowledge in scientific writing and to promote skill development.
The following norms are approved for the process:
(1) Doctoral students are eligible to apply for the certification. The certification is
especially relevant for scholars who are planning to present their research in
international conferences abroad or are drafting their first communique. IITGN
students can obtain certification at no cost.
(2) The certification process will be conducted twice every year to ensure a

manageable number of applicants in each round; suggested timings are during Jan-
Mar and Aug-Oct.

(3) Applicants will be required to undergo two phases:
 Phase I: Submission of two (2) written works: 1) a poster (mandatory) and
2) a scientific article of their work (e.g., a manuscript or a proposal). Both
written submissions should be the students’ original works without any
revisions done by their faculty advisors. To assess the students' written works,

Academic Affairs Advisory (Version 1.0, August 2020 Page 2
faculty in their respective disciplines and their research advisors may be
involved. Written submissions will be assessed on the basis of logical
coherence, ability to convey complex ideas, grammar, and language skills.
Computer-based plagiarism checking systems will be employed during
grading.
 Phase II: Undertake a written examination that will test the applicant’s
awareness of the principles of scientific writing (e.g., clarity, preciseness,
coherence, and logical order), information paraphrasing, quotation and
summarization, academic integrity and ethics, plagiarism, make an argument
and structure of academic works. It will also test their ability to visualize and
interpret data.
(4) The Institute Library and the Writing Studio are expected to provide resources and
support in training applicants on the various aspects of Scientific Writing, including
but not limited to on-campus workshops and training sessions, access to journal
articles, webpages, and videos, and access to visiting resource personnel. A
database with content on the different topics of Scientific Writing should be created.
For example, a dedicated website on Scientific Writing can be created to pool content
from different resources.
(5) Phase I assessment of written submissions will follow a grading matrix that
reviews multiple parameters. The grading matrix is as follows:

1. Background: “Director’s PhD Fellowship” at the Indian Institute of Technology
(IIT) Gandhinagar is intended to encourage top-quality IIT Gandhinagar students
to join the PhD programme of the Institute right after completing their degree
(BTech/MSc/MA/MTech) at the Institute. Having excelled in their academics at IIT
Gandhinagar, such students could transition to their PhD programme with ease
and complete the PhD work faster than the other students.
2. Eligibility
● BTech/MSc/MA/MTech students of IIT Gandhinagar in the final year of their
UG/PG programmes are eligible to apply.
● Applicants must have secured a specified minimum CPI. The minimum CPI
will be 8.0 for applicants from the BTech programmes, 8.5 for MSc/MA
programmes and 9.0 for MTech programmes.
● Since, the selection to this fellowship happens before graduation, the offer to
this fellowship will be conditional to the student securing the above minimum
specified CPI at the time of graduation.
● The CPI before any Pass/Fail grade conversion will be considered.
3. Selection process:
● There will be a call for applications during Semester 1 (July to November) of
every year.
● A discipline level screening committee will shortlist eligible applicants for the
fellowship. The Chairman, Senate will form an Institute level selection
committee which will interview shortlisted candidates and make appropriate
recommendations for consideration of the Chairman, Senate through Dean
(Academic Affairs).
● If an eligible student wishes to apply for the fellowship after the regular call for
applications, he/she may send a request to the Dean (Academic Affairs) for
consideration. Such requests may be considered on a case by case basis.
However, all such requests must be made before graduation from the eligible
programmes.
4. Scholarship: Students joining the PhD programme under this fellowship are
expected to complete his/her PhD within four years of joining the programme.
The selected students shall be provided fellowship for four years during their PhD
programme as given below:
● Rs. 50,000/- (Rs. 31,000/- usual fellowship + Rs. 19,000/- additional
fellowship) per month for the first two years of their PhD programme.
● Rs. 55,000/- (Rs. 35,000/- usual fellowship + Rs. 20,000/- additional
fellowship) per month for the next two years of their PhD programme.

Academic Affairs Advisory 49 (Version 1.0, September 2021) Page 2 of 2
In case a student cannot complete his/her PhD programme within four years of
joining the programme, the student may be given a regular PhD fellowship
(Rs. 35,000/- per month at present) for the fifth year.
5. Expectations:
 The student must maintain a CPI of 8.5 or more at every stage of the PhD
programme to retain the additional fellowship. The Institute will also
discontinue the additional fellowship if a student accumulates three or more
unsatisfactory (U) grades for PhD thesis units.
 A rigorous midterm review of the progress of the student will be carried out by
an Institute level committee setup by the Dean (Academic Affairs) after
completion of two years in the PhD programme. The additional fellowship will
be discontinued in case the student’s progress is not found satisfactory by the
review committee.
 The student will be required to clear the qualifying examination and get
themselves certified in Scientific Writing within one year of joining the PhD
programme. The additional fellowship may be stopped permanently in case
the student fails to complete these requirements within the specified period.
6. Service: Students availing of the Director’s fellowship are required to spend 12
hours per week for Institute activities, including support to teaching activities of
the Institute.
7. Tuition fee, curriculum structure and other regulations:
● The student may join the PhD programme during the summer term
immediately after completing all the credit requirements for their previous
degree.
● The student will be assigned a supervisor at the beginning of the programme,
and a Doctoral Studies Committee (DSC) is to be formed within one month of
joining the PhD programme.
● The Institute expects the student to start research work related to his/her
thesis right from the beginning of the programme. The students are expected
to register for thesis units in the first semester of their PhD programme itself.
● The Institute will encourage the selected students to apply for prestigious
external fellowships like the PMRF.
● The fees structure and other regulations will be the same as that of the
regular PhD programme at IIT Gandhinagar.",

(Senate in its 9

th Meeting held on 17th November 2011 approved the following)
Elective courses for the undergraduate programmes at IITGN are de-compartmentalized
permitting students to opt for courses based on their interest, prior preparation and options
exercised earlier. In the context of electives, the origin of a course holds less importance
compared to its ability to contribute to the students’ overall progress in the programme of their
undertaking.
In addition, it is possible that a course:
 Which is not generally offered by the same discipline but helps the students deepen their
understanding in the core discipline, may also be considered for Honours with the
approval of the DPC and the DOAA.
 Which is not generally offered by that particular discipline, but helps the students deepen
their understanding in the core discipline, may also be considered for Minor with the
approval of the DPC and the DOAA.
In effect, a course X offered by discipline A may be counted for Honors/Minor in discipline B if
the faculty group related to discipline B feels that the objectives of course X give depth in any
area of discipline B.
No registrations will be permitted if there are time table clashes.",

(Senate in its 4th Meeting held on 2nd December 2010, 6th Meeting held on 27th February
2011 and 30th meeting held on 17th April 2018 approved the following)

1) The two semesters in a year shall be referred to as “Semester I and Semester II”. The
mid semester breaks should preferably be around Dussehra and Holi festivals, in order
to minimize absence of students from classes due to these festivals. However, if in a

certain year, Dussehra / Holi fall too far away from the middle of the semester, the mid-
semester break may be placed near the middle of the semester.

2) Final grades be submitted within 96 hours of completion of Examination III of that
particular course. In case of abnormal grading, some moderation of grades may be
necessary. These cases may be flagged to the Chairman, Senate on a case-to-case
basis by Dean (AA).
3) The Academic Calendar sets a date, normally two weeks after the commencement of the
semester, for Course Adjustment. On or before this date, a student is permitted to make
adjustments in her/his academic load by addition or deletion of one or more courses,
projects etc., provided the total credits do not exceed the overload rule or fall below
underload limits, by such adjustments. Course adjustment has to be done via IMS, in
consultation with the Faculty Advisor.
4) A student may drop one or more course(s) out of the registered ones up to 7 days before
the commencement of Examination III. Such requests must be made with proper
justification and will be approved by the Dean (Academic Affairs) on recommendation of
the Faculty Advisor. The following implementation plan will be adhered to:
a) In case the student faces difficulty in some course, he/she should first
discuss with the instructor and faculty adviser. For genuine difficulties

he/she may apply for dropping the course within two weeks after mid-
semester recess, by mentioning the reason and getting consent of

the Instructor and FA.
b) The provision of dropping a course until one week before Examination
III will be available only for rare cases under unavoidable conditions.
Such requests will be expected to enclose additional sheet of detailed
explanation with endorsement from Faculty Advisor and GPS Advisor
if applicable.

Academic Affairs Advisory 07 (Version 3.0, December 2022) Page No. 2

c) Unless the request is approved, the student must keep on attending
the classes/activities and follow up with academic office in case of
any confusion. Merely submitting the application is not considered
approved.

6) Course/s dropped by a student may be taken during a subsequent semester or during the
summer term (if offered).
A student may be required to drop a course at any stage if it is found that he/she does not meet
the pre-requisites of the course, or if there is a clash in the student’s time table preventing

45,NORMS FOR LATE REGISTRATION OF STUDENTS,Academic Affairs,General,"NORMS FOR LATE REGISTRATION OF STUDENTS
(Senate in its 9

th Meeting held on 17th November 2011 approved the following)
It is imperative for most of the students to complete their registration requirements on the
prescribed date of registration by the Senate and start attending classes from the first day.
This provides sufficient time for the students to understand the requirements in different
courses and adjust their registered courses within stipulated add/drop period. It also
facilitates the flexibility of any adjustments in the Time Table to help the students with time
clashes in courses of their interest. The facility of late registration, however, permits a
student with genuine, and often unavoidable, reasons to complete this requirement at a later
date within a week and start attending classes from that time onwards.
However, a student registering late loses right to ask for any relaxation/help against any time
clash besides missing important discussions at the beginning of courses. In the interest of
the students in general, the late registrations are strongly discouraged except in a few cases
when it is genuinely needed due to unavoidable circumstances.
The following penalties are thus proposed to discourage casual late registrations:
a) A student registering within first THREE days of classes after the date of (normal)
registration will pay a penalty of Rs 5,000/-
b) A student registering after THREE days of classes, as mentioned in point (a) above,
will pay a penalty of Rs10,000/-
c) Registration is not permitted after the last date of late registration
d) If a student seeks prior permission to register late on valid grounds, DOAA may
reduce/waive the payment of late registration penalty.
e) The amount collected through the penalty can be utilized in general to help the
students needing temporary financial support or other similar student activities.
The proposed penalties for late registration are also made keeping in mind the need to know
expected registration strengths in different courses in order to take corrective measures in
time. The provision of pre-registration allows advance information of registration and
therefore enables students to make informed choices before the registration deadline.",
46,Conduct of Examinations,Academic Affairs,General,"Conduct of Examinations

For Faculty
 The course is completely owned by the Instructor-in-charge from the beginning of the
course to the submission of grades.
 Responsibility for the smooth conduct of examination lies with the Instructor. The
Instructors are expected to be present during the examination and coordinate the
conduct of examination including confirmation of invigilators and other resources.
 TAs are allocated to help the Instructors with invigilation only and should not replace
them in any manner. However, the TAs should be given full authority for effective
invigilation.
 The invigilators must keep the mobile phones in 'Silent Mode' during the conduct of
the examination.
 Letter grades must be submitted within 96 hours after the day of Examination III. The
grades of a course with no Examination III, including project courses, seminars,
thesis, etc, must be submitted with 96 hours from date of Examination III for that
semester. The grades of a half-semester course must be submitted within 96 hours
after the date of final evaluation of that course.
 Students must be given an opportunity to see their graded answer scripts of all
examinations before submission of the grades. Please also see the advisory on
“Continuous evaluation and timely feedback”.
 Graded answer scripts of the examinations must be retained by the Instructor for at
least six months. In case of short-term visiting Instructors, the answer scripts must be
kept with Discipline coordinator or Dean of Academic Affairs.
 The grades cannot be changed once submitted and processed. Any grade change
request shall require approval of the Chairman, Senate. Such a request must be
submitted on the prescribed format with necessary details of the grading procedure
and by highlighting the proposed changes.
For Students
 Be seated in the exam room at least 5 minutes before the start of exam
 Ensure you are not carrying any material which may be counted under unfair means.
 Punishment of using unfair means can go up to termination of programme from the
Institute. Even being a suspect of using unfair means can lead to severe
repercussions.
 Carrying mobile phones, smart watches or any other electronic communication
devices to the exam room is strictly prohibited. Preferably leave them in your hostel
room.
 In case you see anybody using unfair means, please report the matter, quietly, to the
Instructor or the Dean, Academic Affairs after the exam.

Course Credits
The credits of a course are based on the scaling of learning new concepts and developing
in-depth understanding. Besides attending the lectures or laboratory sessions, the students
are expected to spend a significant amount of time on learning the same concepts more in
depth and imbibe those concepts through assignments, exercises, projects and reading
reference material. The credits assigned to a course reflect the amount of effort a student is
expected to put in that course.It is expected that the student will spend at least double the
period outside the lectures for further learning on the topics covered. Part of this further
learning may come from tutorial component associated with some of these courses, which
will help the students in streamlining their thoughts and discussing their doubts with the
instructor/Tutor.
Usually the courses will have 3 lectures per week with approximately 40 lecture hours in a
semester, which is defined as a 4 credit course.
The laboratory component is generally associated with the courses and the students are

Academic Affairs Advisory 17 (Version 3.0, January 2014) Page 2
expected to spend almost the same time outside the lab for initial preparation and generating
the reports. Generally, 2-3 hours of laboratory contact hours per week will earn one credit.
Besides the regular courses, there are equivalent credits given for Short module courses.

Approval of a New Course
A new course can be proposed by any faculty member in a prescribed format. The
Coordinatorof the concerned discipline sends out the proposal to all faculty members to elicit
their comments and suggestions, with a copy to the Chairperson, SAPC. After a minimum
period of two weeks, the proposal is revised (if necessary), taking into account all the
comments / suggestions received. The Coordinator of the disciplinethen writes to the
Chairperson, SAPC for approval of the course.
The SAPC can constitute sub-committees to design/ modify core courses. The proposals are
then circulated to all faculty for eliciting their comments/ suggestions and subsequent
revision (if necessary) before submitting to the Senate for approval. Similarly, the discipline
specific courses are designed/modified by the concerned discipline, processed by respective
DPC using the procedure stated above and submitted to SAPC for approval.

student is done by awarding a letter grade in each of his/her courses by the concerned
Instructor-in-Charge, considering his/her performance in the various examinations,
quizzes, assignments, laboratory work (if any), etc., besides regularity of attendance in
classes. The grades are submitted to the Academic Section within the prescribed time limit
of 96 hours of the end of Examination III/last evaluation of the concerned course.
Each Discipline shall evolve a procedure for the award of letter grades in project courses.
The letter grades and their numerical equivalents on a 10-point scale (called Grade
Points) are as follows:
Letter
Grade

A+ A A- B B- C C- D E F

Grade
Points 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 2 0
• In addition, there are letter grades I, P, which stand for Incomplete, Pass,
respectively. The credits with grade P are not counted in SPI/CPI calculation.
• Letter grade A+ is given point value of 11 as a mark of excellence.
• The SPI/CPI at the end of any semester shall have the maximum limit of 10. In case
the SPI/CPI calculation shows the grade point value more than 10, it shall be limited
to 10 points.
• The letter grades E and F both are considered as fail grade; a student will have to
repeat/replace the course in which he/she gets fail grade. If someone fails in the
Foundation Programme, he/she can replace it by a course in Humanities (a General
Education course in case of students admitted from 2022-23). The letter grade E
may be considered as grade for sufficient exposure to satisfy the pre-requisites of
another course, wherever applicable. The letter grade E will be removed from the
grading system from Semester 1, 2023-24.
• The units of thesis/projects will be graded using letter grades S, U, which stand for
Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, respectively. For students admitted from Semester 1,
2023-24, thesis units will be graded using letter grades A, B, C and F. A, B and C
are pass grades and F is a fail grade. However, the grades for thesis units will not
be counted towards calculating SPI/CPI.
b) Incomplete Grade ‘I’ - A student may be awarded the grade ‘I’ (Incomplete) in a course if
he/she has missed, for a genuine reason, a minor part of the course requirement but has
done satisfactorily in all other parts. An ‘I’ grade is not awarded simply because a student
has failed to appear in examination(s). An ‘I’ grade must, however, be converted by the
Instructor-in-Charge into an appropriate letter grade and communicated to the Academic

Academic Affairs Advisory 18 (Version 4.0, April 2023) Page 2
Section by the last date specified in the academic calendar for disclosure of grades. Any
outstanding ‘I’ grade after this date shall be automatically converted into the ‘F’ grade.
c) Project Grades – Project grades shall be submitted by the last date specified for the
submission of grades. An ‘I’ grade will not be given for mere non-completion of project.
An ‘I’ grade may be given only on medical grounds.
d) Thesis Grades: A student earns 4 credits for each thesis unit he/she is registered in a
semester. The grade S or U will be awarded for thesis units as follows:
At the end of the Semester, the thesis supervisor(s) will assess the student’s progress
towards the thesis work during the semester and will award the grade S for each unit if
the work is satisfactory and U for every unsatisfactory unit. Thus, a student registered for
4 units can get one of the following five combinations SSSS, SSSU, SSUU, SUUU, UUUU.
Format for the Ph.D. thesis grades in the student’s transcripts
Thesis Units Thesis Credits Grading Options
5 20 5S, 4S1U, 3S2U, 2S3U,1S4U,5U
4 16 4S, 3S1U, 2S2U, 1S3U, 4U
3 12 3S, 2S1U, 1S2U, 4U
2 08 2S, 1S1U, 2U
1 04 1S, 1U

A thesis unit which is awarded U grade will not be counted towards completion of the
required thesis credits. For students admitted from Semester 1, 2023-24, thesis units will
be graded using letter grades A, B, C and F. A, B and C are pass grades and F is a fail
grade. However, the grades for thesis units will not be counted towards calculating
SPI/CPI.
e) Change of Grade Already Awarded - A letter grade once awarded shall not be changed
unless the request made by the Instructor-in-Charge of the course is approved by the
Chairman, Senate. Any such request for change of grade must, however, be made within
six weeks of the start of the next semester in the prescribed form with all relevant records
and justification.
f) Semester Performance Index (SPI) – The Semester Performance Index (SPI) is a
weighted average of the grade points earned by a student in all the courses credited and
describes his/her academic performance in a semester. In case of P grade in a course, the
credits of that course are dropped from calculation of SPI. If the grade points associated
with the letter grades awarded to a student are g1, g2, g3, g4, and g5 in five courses and the
corresponding credits are c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5, the SPI is given by
��� = �&�& + �)�) + �*�* + �+�+ + �,�,
�& + �) + �* + �+ + �,

g) Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) - The Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)
indicates the overall academic performance of a student in all the courses registered up
to and including the latest completed semester/summer term. In case of P grade in a
course, the credits of that course are dropped from calculation of CPI. It is computed in the

Academic Affairs Advisory 18 (Version 4.0, April 2023) Page 3
same manner as the SPI, considering all the courses (say, n), and is given by

��� = ∑ �/�/ 0
/1&
∑ �/ 0
/1&

Whenever a student is permitted to repeat or substitute a course, the new letter grade
replaces the old letter grade in the computation of the CPI, but, both the grades appear
on his/her Grade Report.
h) Grade Report - A copy of the Grade Report is issued to each student at the end of the
semester. A duplicate copy, if required, can be obtained on payment of the prescribed
fee.
i) Withholding of Grades – The grades of a student may be withheld if he/she has not paid
his/her dues, or if there is a case of indiscipline",

50,NORMS FOR PASS/FAIL OPTION AND SUBSTITUTION OF COURSES,Academic Affairs,General,"NORMS FOR PASS/FAIL OPTION AND SUBSTITUTION OF COURSES
(As approved by Senate in its 15th meeting held on 03 January 2014 and

in its 66th meeting held on 16 October 2023)

It is felt important to encourage students to explore courses in areas in which they have little
background and promote additional learning among the students through courses beyond
minimum graduation requirements. It will be useful to have provisions against decline in overall
performance indices of the students. In view of this, the Senate approved the following
provisions in the curriculum of all programmes.
A. PASS/FAIL OPTION IN COURSES
1. A student can submit request to convert his/her earlier registered course(s) with
passing grade(s) to Pass/Fail option. Each student will have this option available for a
maximum of two courses for conversion during the entire programme. The course
tagged with this option will be dropped from CPI calculation.
2. BTech students can use this option any time after completing two years into the
programme. The students in other programmes can use this option any time after their
first semester into the programme.
B. REPEATING/SUBSTITUTING COURSES
1. A student can repeat a compulsory course or a particular elective course to improve
his/her understanding of the subject as well as his/her CPI, irrespective of his/her
performance in the earlier attempt. Better of the two grades will be counted towards
CPI calculation and only the best grade obtained will be shown on the Academic
Transcript.
2. Courses, which are counted towards graduation requirements, with fail grades will not
be shown on the Academic Transcript, if a passing grade is obtained by a student later
by repeating the course, i.e. only the final grade which is used for calculation of the
CPI will be mentioned in the Academic Transcript.
3. A student can substitute one elective course by another elective course to improve
his/her CPI, irrespective of his/her performance in the earlier course. Given the

provision of Proficiency Transcript, substitution need not be declared by the student a-
priori and the student may select courses to appear in Proficiency and Academic

transcripts at any point of time and definitely before claiming the completion of
graduation requirements.
4. The grades of all attempts for courses which are repeated or substituted will however
be shown in the semester grade report and will be used in the calculation of the
corresponding SPIs.
The scheme will be effective for all the students admitted in 2013 batch and afterwards.
However, the provisions on repeating/substituting courses may be allowed to students that
were admitted prior to 2013 batch students on case to case basis by Dean (Academic Affairs).",

(As approved by the Senate in its 18th meeting held on 25th September 2014)
Exposure to industry plays an important role in professional education of the students. Such Industry
visits also help the Institute to build long-term relationships with those industries, which can be helpful
in creating research opportunities and placement of the students. The Institute recognizes the
importance of industry visits of the students. Some of instructors in various courses have been
organizing such industry visits from time to time. The feedback from such visits has been
encouraging. However, these visits are only a few and dependent on the interest of individual
instructors in only a few courses, it is expected to encourage industry visits of the students on a
regular basis.
1. Each of the undergraduate and masters students of the Institute is expected to visit at least
TWO industries in each semester. The Ph.D students and faculty/staff will be welcome to join
such visits. The word industry in the current context will be interpreted in the most liberal
sense and will include site visits, visits to NGO’s and slums, R&D Labs etc.
2. These visits are likely to be in vicinity of Ahmedabad. The Institute will provide reasonable
travel support for such visits on case to case basis. The organizing team will seek budget
approval through Dean, Academic Affairs.
3. It is expected that Career Development Service (CDS) and the Academic Coordinators of
various disciplines will work together to arrange for these visits. In addition to the visits
arranged by the instructors of various courses, senior Doctoral students and Post-doctoral
research scholars will be also encouraged to coordinate such visits for the students. It is
expected that a team of UG and PG students will have active role in organizing these visits.
4. The CDS will compile the data on the students who participated in each visit. This information
may be useful in evaluation of engagement of individual students.

funded by the Institute for the entire internship duration.
4. A faculty member may supervise and guide additional interns (external and internal) beyond the
two that are financially supported by the Institute. These interns will also have to pay the prevailing
hostel charges. Faculty members may choose to support these interns through their CPDA, PDA,
and project(s). The stipend may be flexible, but faculty members are encouraged to pay the interns
enough to cover the hostel charges at least.
5. For faculty willing to accommodate interns recommended by the institute (e.g., IITRAM students,
FFE students, or students coming in through other partnerships), a stipend may come from the

Institute on a case-to-case basis. These interns will be counted separately from the two institute-
supported interns. These interns will also typically have to pay the prevailing hostel charges.

6. For interns selected through competitive internship programs (e.g., Indian Academy of Sciences
internships), the stipends will generally be paid by an external agency. However, these students
must also pay the prevailing hostel charges.

leave IITGN. In case of any delay in report preparation, SRIP coordinators should be informed in
advance.
9. SRIP certificates will be issued only by the SRIP coordinators and not by individual supervisors.
For Interns
1. Interns are required to submit a one page research proposal to SRIP coordinators within one week
of their joining. The proposal should be written in consultation with the faculty advisor and should
provide details on the aim, methodology, and outcome measures of the intended work.
2. Interns should give their best effort in their projects and meet the expectations of the IITGN faculty
regarding the quality and quantity of research work undertaken.
3. Interns are encouraged to use IITGN facilities such as the library, subscribed journals, and
research labs during their internship. However, these facilities must be used responsibly and
generally only for the internship project. Interns must abide by guidelines for the usage of such
facilities.
4. SRIP interns are expected to be present on campus during the entire internship period. SRIP
coordinators may record attendance.
5. Before taking any leave or vacation during the program, interns must take the approval of both the
supervisor and SRIP coordinators.
6. Interns are advised to contact SRIP coordinators for any assistance and counseling during the
internship period.

57,NORMS FOR FEES PAYMENT BY STUDENTS,Academic Affairs,General,"NORMS FOR FEES PAYMENT BY STUDENTS

(As approved by the BoG in its 25th meeting held on 03 December 2018)
The Board of Governors in its 25th meeting held on 03 December 2018 approved
following norms for payment of fees.
1. Deadline: The deadline for payment of all applicable fees for a particular
semester will be 15 days before the registration date of that semester. All
students already enrolled at the Institute must pay the fees by this deadline. New
students must pay their fees by the date mentioned in the offer letter.
2. Late Payment Penalty: Failure to pay the fees by the specified deadline will result
in a penalty of 1% of the fees (but a minimum of Rs.500/-) that is overdue.
Further, if a student fails to pay the fees due within 30 days of the registration
date for that semester, his/her registration for that semester may be cancelled.
3. Extension of Deadline: Extension of the fee payment deadline may be permitted
on a case-to-case basis. In case a student requires additional time for fee
payment, he/she may submit a detailed explanation to the Academic Office by
the fee payment deadline. The Dean, Academic Affairs, upon careful review, may
permit such an extension.
4. Financial Assistance: A student requiring financial assistance of any kind for fee
payment from the Institute must approach the Student Affairs office and do the
necessary paperwork well ahead of the specified deadline. In case of loans taken
from outside the Institute, students must again ensure that the paperwork is done
well in time, and the fees are deposited by the specified deadline.
5. Semester Leave: In case a student applies for semester leave before the date of
registration of a semester, he/she will not be required to pay fees for that
semester. In case a student has already paid the fees, they will be fully refunded.
However, if a student applies for semester leave on or after the date of
registration, the Institute fees will neither be refunded nor adjusted towards a
subsequent semester. However, the hostel and mess fees may be refunded on a
pro-rated basis upon the student’s request to the Student Affairs office.
6. Withdrawal from Program: In case a student withdraws from his/her program on
or after the day of registration, the Institute fees will not be refunded. However,
the hostel and mess fees may be refunded on a pro-rated basis upon the
student’s request to the Student Affairs office.",
58,NORMS FOR CREDIT TRANSFER FROM ONLINE COURSES,Academic Affairs,General,"NORMS FOR CREDIT TRANSFER FROM ONLINE COURSES

(As approved by the Chairman, Senate on 31st March, 2020)

Objective:
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which make university courses available to
thousands of students, are disruptive, technology-driven learning platforms that are
challenging traditional educational models. With the ability to reach a large number of learners
around the world, MOOCs have made a visible and largely positive impact on open education.
Allowing students to learn via these platforms and get credit for it opens up the opportunity for
new ways for students to access knowledge and develop their skills. This in turn liberalizes
their education and also forces traditional classroom learning to evolve. Numerous companies
also recognize the value addition from, say, a Udacity nanodegree or a Coursera Capstone
project. Additionally, MOOCs can be leveraged to enhance our own course offerings (e.g., by
using flipped classrooms) and add to the richness of our overall catalogue. In this context, the
following is proposed.
Features:
1. Students at IITGN may be encouraged to take courses on various online platforms (see
“Platforms” below).
2. Up to 16 credits worth of coursework for UG (B.Tech.) students and up to 8 credits worth
of coursework for PG students (M.Sc., M.A., M.Tech, Ph.D.), completed via MOOCs, may
be counted towards the graduation requirements.
3. The MOOCs will be treated as simply having “Passed” or “Failed”. In other words, credits
earned via MOOCs will not count towards a student’s CPI. However, the total number of
“Pass/Fail” credits over the entire coursework of a student in a program will be capped at
16 for undergraduate students and 8 for postgraduate students (see “Pass/Fail
Considerations” below).
4. Core courses will typically not be allowed; MOOCs will count towards electives only.
However, in exceptional circumstances or in case of certain courses (for instance,
Computing), the Chairman, Senate may permit that credits earned in core courses (or
their close equivalent) via MOOCs be counted towards graduation requirements.
5. MOOCs registered by a student during a semester will not count towards the credit
overload. However, a student may not register only for MOOCs during a semester;
registration for some courses at the institute (with full fee payment) will be required.
6. The institute may consider reimbursing part of the costs incurred by a student towards the
MOOCs upon presentation of the original course completion certificate (see Financial
Structure below).
7. Students on suspension may register for MOOCs and earn credit.

Details:
1. Types of Courses:
1. Faculty Sponsored: These courses will be shepherded by IITGN faculty, and would
be largely in his/her area of interest. The “sponsoring” faculty will be responsible for
coordinating course logistics, meeting with students periodically, organizing review
sessions, conducting tutorials, solving doubts, coordinating with the original course
instructor (when possible) for live interactions with the students, monitoring the
conduct of exams for the course, submitting grades, etc.
2. Courses done directly by students: Students are free to choose their own courses on
MOOCs (subject to the conditions below). These may be, for example, in areas that
are under-represented at IITGN in terms of faculty expertise. The responsibility of
completing such courses lies with the student.

2. Platforms:
A. Swayam – NPTEL
1. All Swayam – NPTEL Online Certification Courses will be included.
2. NPTEL MOOCs have the advantage of localization and context, are generally taught
by IIT / IISc / IIM / IISER / AIIMS faculty, include an on-site proctored exam, cost much
less than other online platforms and provide enhanced interaction opportunities with
the actual instructors. The quality of course offerings on NPTEL has significantly
improved over the years, more rigor has been added, and this continues to be a focus
area for the NPTEL team. Thus, there are clear advantages to NPTEL MOOCs.
3. NPTEL courses are typically 4 week, 8 week and 12 week long, and are offered in
slots that are generally aligned with the IITGN semesters. The 4-, 8- and 12-week
courses will map onto 1, 2 and 3 credits respectively in the IITGN system.
B. Non-NPTEL platforms
1. There is an extremely high level of heterogeneity in the nature, duration, expectations,
format and logistics of MOOCs on other platforms such as Coursera, EdX, Udacity,
etc. Yet, for the benefit of the students, MOOCs on these platforms may also be
included towards the graduation requirements.

2. The courses (and credits) on non-NPTEL platforms will be approved on a case-by-
case basis. A student wanting to include a course from these platforms will provide a

justification on how/why a certain course can be mapped to an equivalent course at
IITGN. The course and the student’s rationale will be vetted by the student’s Faculty
Advisor and he/she will make a detailed recommendation to the Dean, Academic
Affairs who will seek approval of the Chairman, Senate. This process must be
completed before the student registers for the course.
3. Once a course on these non-NPTEL platforms has been approved, it will continue to
remain approved for three years and no fresh approvals will be needed for subsequent
students wanting to take the same course.
C. Additionally, each discipline may identify a set of top quality MOOCs in various domains
independent of the platform on which they are offered and seek approval from the
Chairman, Senate for this set of courses. Students may then freely register for these
courses without having to go through the process mentioned in B2 above.

3. Financial Structure:
1. Enrolment in NPTEL courses is typically free of cost, as is watching the videos and
submitting the weekly assignments. However, the registration for the in-person
proctored certification examination requires payment of a nominal fee (currently about
Rs. 1,000).
2. The cost on other non-NPTEL platforms varies considerably.
3. To begin with, students will be expected to pay the cost associated with the course on
any platform. However, for faculty sponsored courses, this cost will be reimbursed to
the students upon producing the course completion certificate.
4. For courses that students do on their own, the costs will have to be borne by the
students themselves.
4. Pass/Fail Considerations:
1. The institute currently provides students the opportunity to convert up to 2 courses in
which they receive a non-fail letter grade to a “Pass” grade. As a consequence, the
course still gets counted towards the graduation requirements, but is not included in
the CPI calculation.
2. The grades for the MOOCs will also be treated similarly, i.e. the student will be
considered as having passed or failed the course. No letter grade will be awarded.
3. The total number of credits that a UG student can claim under the Pass/Fail option will
be capped at 16 (combined across courses done online and at the institute)..
Likewise, the total number of credits that a PG student can claim for this benefit will be
capped at 8 (combined across courses done online and at the institute). However, no
student may convert more than two courses done at the institute to Pass/Fail (see
examples below).
4. Examples:
i. A UG student successfully completes four 3-credit courses online. These, by
default will be considered as “Pass” and thus will be counted in the 16 credit
limit. The student can then convert a non-Fail letter grade of only one more 4-
credit course done at the institute to a “Pass” grade.
ii. Another UG student does not take any courses online. This student can
convert a non-Fail letter grade to a “Pass” grade in a maximum of two courses
done at the institute.
iii. A PG student successfully completes one 2-credit course online. This student
can utilize the “Pass/Fail” option for two 3-credit courses or one 4-credit and
another 2-credit course done at the institute.
iv. A PG student does no course online. The student can convert a non-Fail letter
grade to a “Pass” grade in a maximum of two courses done at the institute.
The provision for credit transfer from online courses will be made available to all students with
effect from Semester II of 2019-20.",
59,GUIDELINES FOR EFFECTIVE TEACHING,Academic Affairs,General,"GUIDELINES FOR EFFECTIVE TEACHING

IIT GANDHINAGAR

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 2
PREFACE
IIT Gandhinagar wishes to set exemplary standards in academics and research.
Central to this goal is adoption of some of the best practices in the planning,
organization, and conduct of courses that are taught at the Institute. The aim of
developing this document is to explicitly lay out some of these best practices in
course conduct, and encourage their implementation. While developing this content,
inputs have been drawn from other reputed institutions from India and abroad.
This document has not been developed as a “rule book”. Rather, it is designed to
serve as a guideline to help develop and maintain a high teaching standard in the
Institute. It also highlights the freedom and flexibility in the operation of courses. It is
hoped that widespread adoption of these practices will enable us to improve and
sustain the quality of instruction at the Institute.

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 4
1. Class schedule
Courses at IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) are typically scheduled to run between 8 AM
and 6:00 PM. All classes start 5 minutes past the hour and end on the hour (i.e., the
first class is at 8:05 AM, and ends at 9:00 AM). It is expected that instructors will
begin the lecture in a timely manner, and be punctual with the class start and end
times (both in the offline and online modes of teaching). This is important in order to
ensure that students are not delayed for their next class. This also provides the next
instructor time to set up the class (in offline mode of instruction). Instructors must
also ensure that students reach the class on time, and are encouraged to monitor
punctuality of students.
The time-table at IITGN is managed centrally. It is advisable that all courses be held
during the time-slot assigned by the academic office. Any rescheduling of assigned
time-slots may be done in consultation with the pre-registered/registered students
and the Dean / Associate Dean, Academic Affairs. Classes may be rescheduled after
written consent has been obtained. Similarly, mid-semester and end-semester
exams must be conducted within the assigned time-slot only.
Each discipline is expected to slot at least one core course in the 8:05 – 9:00 AM
time slot. This is important so that spillover of core courses into the afternoon slots is
avoided and these slots can be better utilized for labs and elective courses.
A 4 credit course typically involves 40 lecture hours over the semester. It is advisable
to not miss any classes. If a class is missed due to the unavailability of the instructor,
it should be compensated via a make-up class decided in consultation with the
registered students so that the 40 lecture hours are maintained.
2. Course Planning and Operation
Thorough preparation is fundamental to effective and smooth operation of courses.
Preparation begins with development of a detailed and rigorous semester-long
course plan for each course. A course plan typically includes course objectives,
modes of student engagement in the course, textbooks and references, grading
policies, academic integrity policies, and a breakdown of topics to be covered in
each lecture. This course plan is to be added in the timetable before registration and
should also be discussed on the first day of class, so that they can make an informed
decision about the courses in which they are enrolling. It is advisable to structure the
course plan in accordance with the desired learning outcomes. It is recommended
that learning outcomes be identified clearly in the course plan. Further, it is advisable
that the course is planned in such a way that there is continuous engagement of
students and the course provides an immersive learning experience through
assignments, projects, and other hands-on learning modules.

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 5
The course plan must indicate the mechanisms to assess the understanding of
students on the topics covered (homework, assignments, projects, reports, papers,
quizzes, exams, assignments, etc.). Because students will be studying multiple
courses during any given semester, information about the evaluation mechanisms
for different courses may help them to prepare their study schedule in advance. The
instructors are also encouraged to include the dates of all evaluation components in
the course plan - this way the semester is neatly planned out for the students. In
addition, for courses run in online mode, the instructors are strongly encouraged to
share the video recordings of each lecture on the classroom website. The feedback
suggests that this step is crucial and very useful to the students.
It is important that students in all disciplines get a sense of how the material they are
studying is relevant in the “real world”. When preparing the course plan, faculty
members are strongly encouraged to think about real-life examples, demonstrations,
and experiments that could be incorporated to give this sense to students. All
demonstrations to be conducted during class hours may be planned prior to the
beginning of the course. The students are to be encouraged to attend, ask
questions, and to enthusiastically learn from the demonstrations. To cultivate
interest, the descriptions of demonstrations may be made available to the students
beforehand. In addition, if the demonstration involves a video recording, it would be
beneficial if this recording is shared before or after the actual demonstration.
Faculty members are also encouraged to espouse active learning strategies and
practices in their courses. These include an emphasis on learning-by-doing,
numerical simulations, doing-before-learning and wherever possible, “making”. Such
practices have been shown to enhance student learning through deeper
engagement and more hands-on experiences. In addition, the instructor may invite
subject experts for providing additional perspectives to enhance the in-class
teaching-learning experience; these lectures are expected to be over and above the
lecture hours associated with the course.
For courses that are taught by faculty from multiple disciplines (for example,
Engineering Graphics, Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Solid Mechanics, etc.), it
is expected that the course plan be developed jointly by all the participating faculty
members / disciplines. This may require extensive consultations and agreement on
quizzes, assignments, tutorials, problem sets, and exams. These deliberations are
expected to be held well before the start of the semester, and a periodic review may
be conducted over the semester.
It is also important that students in such courses gain an understanding of a
particular concept via exposure to problems from many disciplines. For instance,
problems from Materials Science, Mechanical Engineering, and Civil Engineering
may be used to enhance understanding of a concept in Solid Mechanics. This is to

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 6
be discussed by the course instructors and tutors, and the course material may be
prepared accordingly.
Similarly, for large courses that involve multiple instructors and tutors (for example,
Introduction to Life Sciences, World Civilizations, Computing, etc.), synchronization
between the instructors and tutors is essential. Instructors and tutors are strongly
encouraged to jointly plan the entire operation of the course before the beginning of
the semester. The tutors are expected to attend all the lectures. In addition, the
instructors should ensure the weekly “course volume” match across sections so that
the course remains properly synced across the groups. It is advisable that the team
of instructors and tutors meet on a weekly basis to ensure good coordination
throughout the entire semester.
Industrial visits are highly encouraged by the Institute. It is recommended that the
course plan include all planned industrial visits and expectations that would be met
through such visits. The enthusiastic participation of students is necessary to
achieve the learning outcomes of industrial visits. Instructors must also ensure that
there are no last minute changes to the visiting schedule that is decided with the
industry colleagues.
The students may be unable to have all their questions answered during the lecture

or tutorial sessions due to limited time. Therefore, it is advisable to have well-
publicized office hours during which instructors, tutors, and TAs are available for

consultation. A large class could be broken up into many sections with an
instructor/tutor/TA in charge for each section.
A full course must be taught by a single instructor. In situations where two or more
faculty members must share teaching (as instructors), permission must be sought in
advance with full justification. Change of instructors for an ongoing course is not
advisable. In exceptional circumstances, a change of instructor may be
recommended by the discipline (with justification) and approved by the Dean,
Academic Affairs. In addition, it is desirable that faculty learn from each other with
regards to best teaching practices. Thus, a discipline-specific (or interdisciplinary)
meeting can be scheduled ahead of the semester to share views and opinions about
teaching certain courses.
Further, each discipline must ensure equitable distribution of course load across
faculty over time. For instance, basic courses that have a large number of students
may be rotated between faculty every couple of years or so. Similarly, large basic
courses may be split into smaller sections as and when needed and possible to give
faculty exposure to teaching basic courses and to enhance student learning.

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 7
3. Learning Outcomes
The success of the academic program depends on the ability of students to make
connections between concepts across courses and developing an intuition towards
applying these concepts in real-world situations. An effective way to design a unit of
instruction is to then think about what students should know and how they should
effectively use that acquired knowledge. Instead of viewing learning outcomes as a
determinant of efficacy of the course at the end of the semester, faculty are
encouraged to design the course such that learning outcomes at the end of each unit
are clear and is thus an evolving concept. Specifying intended learning outcomes for
students will also enable effective design of teaching and learning activities that
might help students achieve those outcomes. Likewise, learning assessments should
also be aligned with the intended learning outcomes. The knowledge of learning
outcomes for each course may also be useful for the evolution of the curriculum in
the long run. Instructors are therefore encouraged to clearly spell out learning

outcomes in the course plan, possibly in a modular fashion, preferably on a topic-by-
topic basis. To ensure students are on course to achieve the desired learning

outcomes, instructors might want to schedule additional (possibly online) office hours
in addition to the regular ones.
4. Attendance Policy
It is recommended that the instructor follows an attendance and class participation
policy. The minimum attendance requirement, its weightage in grade evaluation if
any, policy on make-up exams etc. should be communicated at the beginning of the
course and should be included in the course plan. The students may also be made
aware of the “Self-Learning Mode”, the information for which is provided in Annexure
1. In case of extended absence by a student, the instructor may work with the
student to develop a plan to make up for the missed course work.
5. Textbooks and other Reference material
A key feature of effective teaching is the selection of instructional materials that meet
the needs of students and fit the constraints of the teaching and learning
environment. As the students will likely be studying multiple courses during a
semester, they may find it convenient to refer to a standard textbook for a course.
Therefore, the instructors are strongly encouraged to follow standard textbooks by
prominent author(s) in the field, and if possible, with additional resource material
such as video lectures by the author(s), extra problem sets, etc. Furthermore,
instructors must develop a tradition of following the same book for an extended
period of time, and frequent changes in the textbook must be avoided. The
instructors should also ensure that multiple copies of the prescribed textbooks are
available in the library prior to the beginning of the course. The library team can also
help with the procurement of textbook for students at discounted rates.

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 8
Students, particularly at the undergraduate level, may need additional guidance
beyond course material and classroom teaching. This can be provided by means of
appropriate reference material. These references should be mentioned in the course
plan, and efforts should be made towards making them easily available to students.
6. Continuous Evaluation
Instructors are free to select assessment methods of their choice, including but not
limited to assignments, projects, quizzes, examinations, presentations, etc. However,
performance of students must be tracked throughout the duration of the course. It is
also preferable to have a mid-semester and end-semester examination as per the
Institute schedule. Any departures from the institute schedule for the mid-semester
and end-semester examinations should be communicated in advance to the students
and require permission of the Dean, Academic Affairs. Instructors may also ensure
that the assessments are distributed uniformly throughout the semester. For
example, the number of quizzes should be approximately the same before and after
the mid-semester. Along similar lines, instructors must avoid clubbing too many
evaluations towards the end of the semester.
The weightage given to different assessment components should be fairly distributed
and announced to the students at the start of the course. Any modification of the
grading scheme or the weightage of components during the course must be avoided.
Such modifications can possibly negatively influence the study schedule of students.
Makeup exams are discouraged except under extreme circumstances. Students
must be made aware of the policies for makeup examinations by the instructor.
For the examinations/assessments, there is a provision for providing compensatory
time to students with Benchmark Disabilities. PwD students (with a minimum 40%
disability) may be allowed compensatory time at the rate of 20 minutes per hour in all
the examinations.
7. Timely feedback to Students
Students can immensely benefit from obtaining feedback on their performance in
assignments, projects, quizzes, and examinations etc. in a timely manner. It is
expected that the assessments are graded and returned to students without any
delay. The students must be given an opportunity to see each of the graded
assessments after grading has been completed. It is highly encouraged to hold
special office hours to provide feedback to students and to clarify any doubts and
answer any questions. Since the end-semester examination is generally the final
point of evaluation for a course, it is advisable to share the results of all evaluations
with each student by the last week of the classes. This will help in the identification
and rectification of any inadvertent mistakes in entry of marks before the grades are
being finalized. Further, as explained in the Academic Affairs advisories, students

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 9
must be given an opportunity to see their graded answer scripts of end-semester
examination before submission of grades i.e. within 72 hours after the day of the
end-semester examination. The instructor may therefore plan accordingly. In addition
to the results of the above assessments, the instructor is expected to regularly
interact with underperforming students and provide them detailed feedback about
their performance.
8. Feedback from Courses and Course Review
The views expressed by students can help the instructor know if the learning
outcomes are being met from a student’s perspective, how students perceive the
course material, the pace of instruction, etc. The mid-semester feedback and the
detailed feedback collected before the end-semester examination are shared with
the instructors and tutors. The Instructor may take the above feedback into
consideration while preparing the course plan and teaching the same course in the
future.
In addition, disciplines should encourage feedback from students in informal settings
like discipline-level town hall meetings or open houses. Discipline coordinators
should further ensure that each course is reviewed at least once every three years.
It is advisable that a schedule is established in order to minimize over-surveying
stakeholders and to ensure that courses are reviewed systematically in a cycle.
Course reviews should focus on the conduct of the course, appropriateness of the
content, student engagement, and assessment methods in order to achieve the
learning outcomes, and the consistency and relevance of the objectives of the
course with the academic program.
9. Grading
The instructor may take the help of teaching assistants in evaluating the
assignments submitted by the students. However, the instructors are expected to
evaluate the answer scripts of the examinations by themselves. The instructors are
advised to prepare a grading key for all assignments, quizzes, and examinations etc.
in order to ensure consistency in grading across all students. The instructor is
generally free to use the grading policy of their choice with regard to weightage to
different assessments over the semester. However, such a policy should be
announced to the students at the beginning of the course; any modification of the
policy during the course is discouraged. The broader grading system is common
across the Institute and details on the same are available in the Academic Affairs
advisories. It is advisable to share the results of all evaluations with each student by
the last week of the classes. This will help in the identification and rectification of
any inadvertent mistakes in entry of marks before the grades are being finalized.
Further, as explained in the Academic Affairs advisories, students must be given an
opportunity to see their graded answer scripts of end-semester examination before

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 10
submission of grades. Grades are required to be submitted within 72 hours of the
conduct of the end-semester examination of the course. If the grading for a particular
course appears to be too liberal or too harsh, the Dean, Academic Affairs may flag
the course to the Chairman, Senate, and a moderation of grades may be requested.
Though the instructor is responsible for all evaluations and the assignment of

grades, it is strongly advised to involve the tutors of the course in the above-
mentioned activities. It is also desirable that new faculty members teaching for the

first time be made aware of these practices by the discipline coordinator.
10. Role of Teaching Assistants
The Teaching Assistants (TAs) are an important part of any course, and must be
utilized properly so as to become an excellent resource to the students. For
effectiveness, TAs must be informed about their duties prior to the beginning of the
course. The TA allocation should be done at least 15 days before the
commencement of the course. This will help in the overall planning of the course and
ensure that the TAs are briefed and fully prepared and trained. The instructor should
encourage the TAs to attend lectures and tutorials, so that they know exactly what is
covered and can provide the right assistance to the students. However, TAs are not
permitted to independently conduct lectures or tutorials (these must be conducted by
faculty). TAs are also not permitted to grade the mid-semester and end-semester
examinations. Graduate Teaching Fellows (GTFs), with prior approval, could be
responsible for the conduct of the entire course as an independent instructor or tutor.
The instructor should ensure that the TAs perform their duties like grading of
assignments, holding regular office hours, etc. in a regular manner and by respecting
the Honor code of the Institute.
11. Lab Courses
The graduate and undergraduate curriculum at the Institute contains a substantial
number of lab courses to help students get an applied sense of theoretical concepts
covered in lectures. Experiments and projects in these courses should be designed
keeping in mind the following goals:
● Develop intuition and deepen understanding of concepts.
● Apply concepts learned in class to new, real-world situations.
● Develop critical, quantitative thinking.
● Develop experimental and data analysis skills.
● Develop reporting skills (written and oral).
● Practice collaborative problem solving.
To ensure that lab exercises run smoothly, experiments must be carefully planned.
The instructor and TAs must be present during the lab sessions. The TAs must be
fully trained on the experiments and safety protocols, and in consultation with the

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 11
instructors, should rehearse the procedure before the lab sessions. It is desirable
that the instructor makes sure all the TAs perform the experiments well in advance
and are aware of all the scientific and technical (instrumentation) aspects of the
experiment in order to guide the students effectively. If necessary, a separate
workshop might be conducted by the discipline for all the TAs before the beginning
of the semester so they step into their roles well prepared. All safety protocols should
be explained to the students at the start of the course. Student learning may be
assessed via impromptu viva sessions, reports or other means. Brief discussions
about the lab exercises during the lecture hours may further enable a better
understanding of the theoretical concepts and also gauge student understanding.

12. Project Courses
Students typically undertake project courses (for example, IN 791, IN 792, CL 399,
etc.) to gain research experience in a particular topic. To ensure effective guidance
and student learning, an instructor may want to limit the number of project students
that he/she is willing to supervise. It is also recommended that the students are
informed about the project objectives, expectations and meeting schedule at the start
of the semester. Since the students pursuing a project may be new to the research
area, they will benefit from the regular meetings with the instructor. The instructors
are expected to continuously evaluate students’ working on the projects. The
students should be encouraged to make a presentation and submit a project
report/term paper at the end of the semester on the subject matter along the lines of
a typical scholarly publication.
In addition to courses that are solely project-based, faculty members are encouraged
to include small projects in regular courses as well - this ties in with the active
learning environment that IITGN aims to provide and promote.
13.Tutorials
An effective tutorial session enables students to gain a better understanding and
appreciation of the fundamentals and concepts. Students learn to apply the concepts
and fundamentals taught in a course to solve a variety of problems. Tutorials must
not be converted into lecture hours. Tutorials are to be run by faculty or graduate
teaching fellows (GTFs) approved for this purpose. Teaching Assistants should not
conduct tutorial sessions. Tutorial batch sizes should be as small as possible,
certainly not more than 40.
For multi-disciplinary courses (e.g, thermodynamics, solid mechanics, etc.), each
concerned discipline is expected to contribute a tutor for a course. It is expected that
each tutor brings in the respective discipline’s flavor into the course. A meeting of

Version 2, Updated on August 1, 2021 Page 12
tutors should be scheduled well in advance, and tutorial (and possibly also
assignment) problem sets should ideally be finalized before the start of the semester.
A tutorial problem set may have sufficient problems of varying degrees of complexity
to meet student diversity. Simpler problems help to build the student’s confidence,
while complex problems challenge the student’s thinking. Further, wherever
possible, the problems should have relevance to practical (or real world) applications
so that the students can see the connection between concepts and applications.
14.Instructor Conduct
Instructors are expected to show civil and courteous conduct when interacting with
students in the classroom or otherwise. It is important for instructors to recognize
that any student performing poorly in a course, not attending class or facing other
challenges still needs to be treated in a dignified and respectful manner. Instructors
must attempt to understand students’ difficulties, address them and bring them to the
attention of all concerned stakeholders.
Particular care and concern should be shown to differently-abled students who might
have trouble grasping the subject material and whose pace of learning might not
match with the rest of the class. Consideration for this aspect should be provided,
and if necessary, a separate mode of examination may be conducted in consultation
with the student(s).
15.Honor Code
Instructors are encouraged to discuss the Honour Code (as provided in the Student
Affairs Advisories) with the students at the beginning of the course. Faculty members
may also:
1. Create awareness to ensure that expectations regarding academic integrity
are understood, and that students are held accountable for conforming to
such expectations.
2. Use good judgment in setting and communicating clear ground rules for
academic work conducted under their supervision.
3. Maintain proper protocols during the administration of examinations
4. Avoid reusing prior examinations in whole or in part to the extent possible.

ANNEXURE 1

SELF-LEARNING MODE

(As approved by the Senate in its 3rd meeting held on 19th July 2010)
Regular attendance in lectures and tutorials is a key factor in enhancing student
performance. The fully residential character of IITGN would be expected to correlate with
greater attendance in the classroom. The Institute does not prescribe any attendance policy
and all decisions pertaining to attendance related issues are entirely left at the instructor’s
discretion. The institute has a provision of study in self-learning mode bearing the following
features:
● Students absenting themselves for more than 3 classes during the first 3 weeks, or,
more than 6 classes during the first 5 weeks to be declared to be in the “self-learning
mode” for that particular course.
● Such students will thereafter be free not to attend any more lectures of that particular
course. Their names will be removed from the attendance sheet. They need not submit
any assignments; if they do, those will not be graded. They need not appear in any
quizzes or mid-semester examinations; if they do those too will not be graded.
● The performance of such students will be evaluated on the basis of the end semester
examination score alone. That is, their final examination score will be compared with that
of the other students (who are not in self learning mode) and the grade will be awarded
accordingly (see illustrative example below).
● The parents of students going on the “self learning mode” are liable to be informed of
this. In particular in cases of first year students and those in higher classes whose CPI is
below average.
● The list of students going on the “self-learning mode” will be provided to the Scholarships
Committee of the Institute, which will be free to use this input in deciding the award of
scholarships for the next year.
● In case of laboratory courses, every student is expected to attend all the laboratory
sessions failing which they are liable to be awarded a Fail grade as applicable.
● In case of medical or other emergencies, timely permission should be sought from the
instructor and deficiencies should be suitably made up.
Illustrative Example:
Assume that the evaluation of a course is based on assignments, quizzes, a mid-semester
exam and an end-semester exam. Let us take the case of three students: student X is in
self-learning mode (and will therefore be evaluated only on the end-sem exam performance),
while the other two students (Y and Z) are not. Now, X, Y and Z all get the same marks on
the end-sem exam. However, Y and Z have also submitted assignments, taken quizzes, etc.
Based on their cumulative performance on all these, say the grade for Y at the end of the
course is a C (because he/she did poorly on several evaluations) while the grade for Z is an
A- (because he/she did well on most evaluations). Now the grade for student X, who is in
self-learning mode, can be either a C, or an A-, or any grade in between. This is at the
discretion of the course instructor.",
60,Norms for Interim Sessions for Course Offerings,Academic Affairs,General,"Norms for Interim Sessions for Course Offerings
(As approved by the Senate in its 41st meeting held on 17th February 2020)

Background:
IIT Gandhinagar follows the semester system in which courses are offered in two semesters
that run from August to November and January to April. A few courses are also offered
through a separate Summer Term from mid-May to early-July, primarily to help students
clear their backlogs.
Given the institute’s increasing emphasis on active, experiential learning, there is a need to
create a separate vehicle for courses to run in an immersive and intensive manner. Such a
format is often followed when projects are the primary form of learning, for example, in
Design schools. It allows students to dedicate their entire effort to project work, without being
distracted by the load of other courses. Specifically, in the context of IITGN, such a
mechanism will also allow the institute to leverage more effectively some Visiting Faculty,
who are at the Institute for a short duration such as a month, but are only able to offer 1-
credit short courses at the moment. In this context, the following is proposed.
Proposal:
1. The institute will develop 3-week “Interim Sessions” to run between the regular
semesters, i.e. during the Summer and Winter breaks.
2. The primary thrust of the Interim Sessions will be to leverage opportunities for
intensive, creative and experimental courses that are most effectively conducted in
immersive, project-oriented, studio, field or travel modules.
3. Innovative 2- or 3-week long courses that meet for 4 to 6 hours per day will be
offered during these Interim Sessions.
4. These courses will typically be electives and offered for credit (see details below),
and IITGN students will be able to count credits earned from such courses towards
their graduation requirements.
5. The Chairman, Senate will approve Interim Session courses upon recommendation
of the Dean, Academic Affairs.
Credits:
1. Since courses in the Interim Sessions will run in an immersive, studio style format,
the expected faculty-student engagement will be higher than usual - about 60 hours
for 4 credits. Thus, a 3-week course that requires faculty-student engagement for at
least 4 hours per day from Monday to Friday, will give students the opportunity to
earn 4 credits. Likewise, a 2-week course that runs at least for 6 hours per day from
Monday to Friday will also yield 4 credits.
2. Credits earned via these courses, besides being counted towards graduation
requirements, will also count towards the Honors and Minors requirements.
3. Courses will typically be of 3 or 4 credits. Any 2-credit course proposals may be
considered for approval on a case-by-case basis.

Academic Affairs Advisory 57 (Version 1.0, June 2022) Page 2 of 2
Eligibility:
1. All IITGN students will be eligible to register for courses during the Interim Sessions.
2. Students from other academic institutions in India as well as abroad may also be
allowed to register for such courses. These Visiting Students will receive transcripts
for their work from IITGN, but will need to determine from their home institutions if the
credits earned will transfer or count toward their graduation requirements.
3. Students may register for only one Interim Session course at a time. This course
should not overlap with any other course (for example, a summer term course).
Fees:
1. For students of Indian academic institutions including IITGN: Summer tuition rates
applicable to IITGN undergraduate students (currently Rs. 5000 per credit) will apply.
2. For international students: USD 400 per credit.
3. Hostel, meals and other charges will be extra, and as per prevailing norms.
4. Additional expenses related to field visits, travel, etc., if applicable, will be borne by
the student.
5. IITGN students that are provided tuition fees waiver during the regular semesters will
be provided tuition fee waiver for the interim session.
6. Tuition fee waivers in other deserving cases may be given by the Director based on
the recommendation of the Dean, Academic Affairs.
Other Details:
1. Courses that are best studied in a slower, progressive manner and require time to
assimilate cannot be offered in the Interim Sessions. Rather, courses that run during
the interim sessions are generally expected to be hands-on, immersive and
experiential.
2. These courses will follow the usual grading pattern and system of letter grades.
Students will however be permitted to convert the letter grades to “Pass/Fail”, subject
to the usual norms of the “Pass/Fail” option.
3. IITGN faculty teaching courses in the Interim Session may receive an honorarium (or
Professional Development funds) in lieu of the teaching load.
Expected Benefits:
The Interim Sessions provide an opportunity to:

1. Leverage Visiting Faculty from India and abroad more deeply by conducting full-
fledged innovative courses, which will be beneficial and of greater appeal to students

than current short courses, which do not count toward their graduation requirements
and which often conflict with their schedule.
2. Attract international and other Indian students who may be interested in some
modules, which could be eligible for credit at their home institution.
3. Enable IITGN to expand its global exchange program by creating course
opportunities for foreign institutions, which their students can avail.
4. Collaborate with study abroad programs of overseas institutions both to host their
students or support their faculty-led study abroad programs.",

66,Standard Operating Procedure on Lab and Fire Safety,Campus Management Advisories,Campus Safety,"Standard Operating Procedure on Lab and Fire Safety

Introduction
With the increasing dependency on electrical gadgets and digital facilities, and chemical usage, it is
imperative that all precautions are put in place for safe use of equipment hazardous materials and
chemicals and safety of users. IITGN the premier institute of Nation is fully equipped with its
modern labs, class rooms and other necessary facilities for use by students, staff and faculty. It
also implies that complexity of all electric systems and chemicals must be carefully studied and
used to avoid any accident. This document lay down certain aspects of handling of hazardous
chemicals, fire prevention and fire fighting in case required.
Fire Prevention
IITGN campus in spread over in approx 400 acres of land, out of which constructed area in its
present state is approx. 118 acres which includes Academic,Hostel and Housing blocks. The
buildings are compact from functional view point at the same time area is sufficiently open to
prevent fire from spreading.
Best way to prevent fire is to understand the probable causes of fire and take adequate
precautions to prevent fire.
Probable Causes of Fire
 Electrical
o Over loading of wires and at power sockets.
o Mishandling of electrical equipment and machinery.
o Loose connection in multi outlets plugs.
o Electrical Heater.
o Loose wiring.
o Improper Insulation at junction points.
o Improper connection with extension cords
 Human Error
o Storage of waste and combustible material near probable source of fire.
o Mishandling of Electrical appliances and machines.
o Mishandling of flammable chemicals and solvents
o Unattended Hot Plate.
o Poor housekeeping.
o Throwing away lighted cigarettes.
 Lab Accidents
o Heating of oxidizing materials by gas flame or oil bath.
o Use of water reactive material in presence of water.
o Exposure to air of pyrophoric materials.
o Storage of Incompatible chemicals.
o Inadequate Ventilation while experimenting with gases.
o Mixing of wrong chemical solutions while doing experiments in lab.
o Storage of gas cylinder in confined space/poor ventilation.
o Un-controlled heat produced by chemical reaction.

o Bunsen burners can pose fire hazards.
o Improper grounding of equipment and machinery.
o Ignorance of MSDS (Material safety data sheet), instructions on safety.
 Natural Calamity: Lightening etc.
Preventive Measures
 General
o Watch against any loose electric connections, short circuiting, sparks from fuse/sockets
etc. and report immediately to concerned staff.
o Ensure all lights are switched off & plugs are pulled out while leaving the room / lab by end
of the day.
o Unattended burning is strictly prohibited.
o Wear lab coats,safety glasses and shoes before enteringlabs with chemicals and heavy
machinery.
o Wear gloves while handling chemicals and corrosive materials.
o Read safety descriptions (MSDS) about the chemicals and solvents thoroughly before
opening the containers.
o Open and handle all chemicals only inside fume hoods.
o Observe fire precautions in cafeteria, canteen &kitchen.
o Maintain clean and clutter free campus.
o Ensure regular inspection and testing of all electrical appliances and wiring.
o Do not leave flame unattained.
o Follow “no smoking” rules in applicable areas.
o Ensure proper ventilation and illumination.
o Be aware of all entry / exit doors to be fire resistant.
o Follow all norms as laid down by local fire office.
o Display important contact details / tele nos in each block at suitable location.
 Preventive measures for Chemical lab: Attached as Appendix ‘A’.
 Preventive measures for Electrical lab: Attached as Appendix ‘B’.
 Preventive measures for handling heavy machines in Civil/ Mechanical / Electrical lab:
Attached as Appendix ‘C’.
 Preventive measures for fire: Attached as Appendix ‘D’.

Action to be Taken in Case of Outbreak of Fire
Famous saying “Man proposes and God disposes” cannot be ignored. If at all unfortunate accident
takes place, IITGN community must be well prepared to stop the fire immediately. For this, each
person must be aware of the actions to be taken as part of collective effort. Awareness capsules,
training and regular practice will contribute immensely towards preventing / stopping fire outbreak.
People
It is important to identify the response force expected to be involved in firefighting and need to be
trained accordingly. These can be classified as under:

First Responders – Security and house- keeping staff along with the researcher who works in the
lab regularly in near vicinity are expected to react first and need to be trained on actions to be
taken and use of firefighting equipment.
Actions by First Responders–The expected sequence of action would be as under:
 Moment fire is noticed; draw attention of all persons around by shouting “FIRE, FIRE, FIRE”.
 Whistle to be blown by security staff onshort spurts to draw attention of persons in near
vicinity.
 By this time the fire alarm system (hotter etc)will get activated and location of fire will be
indicated. It is possible that first indication of fire comes from alarm system before anybody
comes to know.
 Security staff or persons from support team (in case security staff is not available at site at
that moment) to immediately take out fire extinguisher from nearest location and try to
extinguish fire.
 In case of electrical fire, immediately switch off the power from nearest mains and use CO2
extinguisher only and not to spray water.
Support Team – All staff and faculty are expected to support firefighting efforts.
Following actions are expected to be taken:
 Faculty/students/staff present near the area of fire must (MUST) maintain calm, evacuate
persons/belongings etc in case stuck inside and ensure there is no stampede like situation.
 Call Gandhinagar fire station and call fire tender, if required.
 Switch off main switch of the affected room / block as applicable in case of electric fire.
 Evacuate persons who may need medical attention on priority.
 Help entry of firefighting staff and fire tender movement up to location of fire.
 Help in de-crowding the area and guide them to pre assigned area, if required.
 Inform police in case situation demand for crowd management.
Training
Training is the most important part of firefighting operation. In case the responder is not trained to
operate the firefighting equipment, he can’t be named as responder. Training can be classified as
under:
(a) Training to handle the equipment (awareness Capsule)
(b) Mock up drills to remain abreast with the training.
(c) Handling of chemicals and lab safety.
Awareness Capsule: Capsule should be conducted atleast once in four months so that all the
security and housekeeping staff undergo this training at least once a year. Capsule should include
following topics:
(a) Likely cause of fire
(b) Preventive measures
(c) Training on equipment handling and its maintenance.
Mock up drill: Mock up exercise is important to check the efficacy of training imparted and
sensitize the community and their participation as part of support team. Mock up drill should be
done once in six months with dummy controlled fire preferably in open area.
Lab Safety: Lab safety training should be conducted once a year to make awareness among
researchers about safe laboratory practices and handling of corrosive, toxic and pyrophoric
chemicals.

72,EXPECTATIONS FROM THE FACULTY BY THE INSTITUTE,Faculty Affairs Advisories,EXPECTATIONS FROM THE FACULTY BY THE INSTITUTE,"EXPECTATIONS FROM THE FACULTY BY THE INSTITUTE

IIT Gandhinagar aspires to be recognized for excellence in education, research, innovation, and
leadership. A thriving atmosphere is envisioned at the Institute where each faculty member is able to
realize his/her potential and enthusiastically contributes to the growth of the Institute. All faculty
members are expected to share the mission, vision, and values of the Institute, possess excellent
personal and interpersonal skills and demonstrate a passionate commitment towards teaching, research,
and service to the Institute, the profession, and the society at large. This document lays out the
expectations from the Institute’s faculty members. The Institute and the community will provide all
possible support - financial, management, ambience – to help the faculty member realize his/her
potential and aspirations.
Teaching
 IIT Gandhinagar believes that teaching is a noble profession and is committed to providing an
enriching and supportive learning environment for its students. Faculty members are expected to
share this enthusiasm and approach teaching with the utmost sincerity and vigour.
 Faculty members are given ample autonomy in structuring the course contents, course materials,
introducing new courses, and using innovative methods of teaching.
 Normal teaching load is three full-semester courses per year for a faculty member. Whenever
possible, the teaching load may be lower (two courses per year) in the first year for an entry-level
faculty member to enable him/her to settle down and establish his/her research activities quickly.
 High-quality teaching in a range of courses is expected from all faculty members along with
excellent feedback and rating from the students. The expected rating is 3.0 (out of 4.0) or higher.
 Faculty members are expected to offer project courses and guide innovative student projects.
 Developing textbooks/monographs/articles on teaching methodology, and developing course
websites (or online course platforms) with electronic lecture notes, slides, and assignments are
encouraged.
 Best practices, as well as Institute norms on teaching, are to be followed.
Research
 Securing external funds for research and developing research facilities, infrastructure, and
laboratories at the Institute.
 Independent research leading to the publication of scholarly research papers/monographs. The
Institute expects 2-3 publications per year in reputed refereed journals/refereed conference
proceedings (excluding those with their own PhD/post-doc supervisors).
 IITGN most values impact of one’s research. Publications in very selective or prestigious
conferences and journals are valued over multiple low-quality publications. Publishing software,
patents, and doing technology transfers are encouraged.
 Research with impact on societal needs is particularly appreciated.
 Guiding PhD and Masters student dissertations and undergraduate research projects. Mentoring
students into future researchers and faculty members. This includes guiding students to publish their
research (typically, with faculty as a co-author and students as lead authors).
 Participation in conferences and research talks at other institutions is encouraged to improve
external impact and help establish research collaborations.
Service
 Enthusiastic and effective participation in committees and other administrative activities.

 Engagement of students outside the class, mentoring/guiding them.
 Helping other colleagues to grow and perform better.
 Participation in external committees (government/industry), PhD thesis examination, etc.
 Providing consultancy services to the industry and government.
 Editing/peer-reviewing for journals and other publications.
 Community outreach activities based on societal needs.
 Organization of continuing education programmes/conferences/workshops.
Personal & Interpersonal Skills
 Intense desire to learn and to grow as an academic, and as an individual.
 Positive attitude, strong commitment, enthusiastic participation in Institute activities.
 Inspiring students and leading by example.
 Treating students and colleagues with dignity and respect.
 Good inter-personal relationships; being a good team player; good communication skills.
 Integrity (moral, intellectual, and financial)
 Appropriate presence in the Institute’s academic area.
Support from the Institute
The Institute will provide a fully functional office when a new faculty member joins. This includes a
desktop computer, printer, etc. Additionally, Rs. 2.5 lakh will be made available upon joining to meet
miscellaneous initial expenses such as purchase of a laptop, tablet, additional desktop, etc.
Each faculty member is expected to develop and submit at least one research proposal for external
funding within 60 days of joining the Institute. If a faculty member does not intend to seek an external
grant, he/she is expected to explain the reasons in writing. For instance, some colleagues working in
theoretical areas may not require funds for their research. A reasonable amount of additional internal
research funds can be provided to assist the faculty members to initiate research activity quickly; the
amount will depend on the requirements and the external project proposal.
In addition to the above funding for research projects, current norms on faculty compensation provide a
discretionary Cumulative Professional Development Allowance (CPDA) of Rs 1,00,000 (Rs One Lakh)
per year to faculty members. This fund can be used for travel to attend meetings in India and overseas,
purchase of equipment and books, membership of professional societies, etc. This allowance can be
accumulated up to Rs 3,00,000 (Rs Three Lakhs).
Sponsored research projects attract an overhead of 20% currently, but the Institute is flexible on this
account and will be willing to accept lower overheads where appropriate. Currently, the Institute
provides 12.5% of this overhead amount for professional development of the concerned faculty
members. At present, the Institute also charges an overhead of 20% of gross receipts of consulting
projects, while 80% funds are made available for discretionary spending towards project activities and
for distribution of honoraria to the concerned faculty members. Consulting money may also be saved
with the Institute in a separate Professional Development Allowance (PDA) for future use on
professional activities. IITGN imposes no upper limit on consulting income a faculty member may earn,
as long as his/her other academic responsibilities are not compromised. It is expected that a faculty
member will spend, on an average, no more than one day per week on consultancy work.
When a faculty member brings in his/her research funds, he/she controls it as the Principal Investigator,
subject to only the constraints that may be imposed by the sponsoring agency. IITGN ensures that there
are no hurdles in spending the money for executing the projects and provides excellent administrative
support. The Institute envisages that with adequate external funding, each faculty member is fairly
autonomous to seek fulfillment of his/her aspirations and goals.",

74,GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING FACULTY CANDIDATES,Faculty Affairs Advisories,GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING FACULTY CANDIDATES,"GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING FACULTY CANDIDATES
1. IIT Gandhinagar has a vision and an aspiration that requires outstanding faculty. The
quality of its faculty will have a tremendous impact in the years to come.
2. Faculty recruitment is the most important and difficult task any university undertakes,
and it requires very sound judgement. Hence, the highest level of integrity is expected
from all those involved in the evaluation of faculty candidates.
3. Recruiting unsuitable candidates has serious long-term negative consequences for the
institute. A conservative approach (of not recruiting when in doubt) is thus more
suitable for faculty recruitment.
4. We acknowledge that there would be errors of judgement. We should be willing to
accept errors and not compound them by offering justifications. In addition, efforts
need to be made to prevent recurrence of such errors.
5. Ownership of the candidates by IITGN faculty members at a personal or a research
area or a discipline level is highly discouraged. Such ownership (e.g., recruiting more
persons in one’s area XYZ and hence pushing a candidate) vitiates the mutual trust in
the recruitment process.
6. Advising faculty candidates on what to do (or not to do) during the selection process is
highly undesirable.
7. Disclosures: All disclosures about relationships/proximity with a candidate to be made
to the Chairman, Faculty Search Committee. However, it is expected that the
concerned faculty will participate in the application processing for this candidate as for
any other candidate without any bias.
8. Mixing of issues is to be avoided, and comments on a candidate must not to be
colored with any other issue. For instance, an outstanding candidate academically with
an abrasive personality should not be called a poor candidate. Instead, it should be
commented that he/she has excellent academic credentials with some personality
issues.
9. Comments to be given within the framework of recruitment philosophy and ethos at
IITGN. For instance, currently, the Institute is focusing on quality of candidates rather
than a specific area. Therefore, comments to be made keeping this in mind.
10. Personality, values, and attitude of the candidate are no less important than his/her
academic/research credentials. Therefore, these should be given a lot of attention as
well.
11. Share the enthusiasm and the positives about IITGN with the candidates. Any
negatives about the Institute should be shared with the Head of the Department or the

Faculty Affairs Advisory 03 (Version 2.0, September 2018) Page 2
Director (and not with the faculty candidate) so that the issues may be suitably
addressed.
12. Share all information (good or bad) available to you about the candidate with
Chairman, Faculty Search Committee. If the information is from an unreliable source,
make that explicit.
13. Internal discussions are confidential and should not be shared with the candidates,
irrespective of whether they are offered a position or not, and irrespective of whether
they join or not.
14. If candidates ask for information that you are not sure about, please refer them to
Chairman, Faculty Search Committee or Professor-in-Charge (FA) or Director. Also,
seek the information for future use.
15. Attend teaching sessions, research seminars, and meet candidates to provide
feedback on their technical and personal attributes. Meeting candidates outside of
one’s area of interest is highly encouraged.
16. Do not give your feedback on a faculty candidate in just one or two words (e.g.
“promising candidate”, or “we should consider him”, or “strongly recommended”).
Instead please mention his/her strong and weak points and the basis of your
judgement before concluding with your recommendation.
17. Some decisions on faculty recruitment are easy to make while many others are not.
There are bound to be differences of opinions. If the final decision on a candidate is
not in line with one’s recommendation, it does not mean that one’s opinion was not
considered important in arriving at the decision. Needless to state, if one feels strongly
that an error of judgment has been made with regard to a candidate, one may feel free
to seek discussion with the Professor-in-Charge (FA) and the Director.
18. The Director may or may not have the opportunity to meet a candidate. Please do not
create an expectation of a meeting with the Director.",
75,PROCESS FOR HANDLING OF FACULTY APPLICATIONS,Faculty Affairs Advisories,PROCESS FOR HANDLING OF FACULTY APPLICATIONS,"PROCESS FOR HANDLING OF FACULTY APPLICATIONS
The Institute has been recruiting many outstanding faculty candidates through the Standing
Committee. This note outlines the flowchart for processing the applications for consideration
through the Standing Committee (a) efficiently and systematically, (b) in a way that does not

take too much time, and (c) which effectively engages the faculty members in the decision-
making process in terms of faculty recruitment at the Institute. Guidelines for evaluating Faculty

Candidates can be found under Faculty Affairs Advisories (advisory #2 and #3) on the Institute
Website.
On Receiving an Application:
Upon receipt of the application, Discipline Search Committee Member (DSCM) will share the
application with all faculty members (within thirty days of the receipt of application) in the
concerned discipline seeking feedback from them within a reasonable amount of time (typically
within seven days). Based on the feedback thus obtained, DSCM will categorize the application
in the A, B, or C category. If there are no or limited responses from the discipline colleagues,
DSCM will categorize the application as per their discretion and will record the same fact. In all
cases, the DSCM can obtain feedback from the Chairman of the Faculty Search Committee

(CFSC), Search Committee Coordinator (SCC) of the concerned discipline, and Professor-in-
Charge (PIC-FA) to rate the application.

Classification of Applications:
● A (High Priority Candidates with excellent credentials to be considered by Standing
Committee on priority)
● B (Candidates where more thought and information is needed to make a better
judgment on whether to pursue the candidature further), and
● C (Candidates that need not be considered by the Standing Committee. May be
considered at the Selection Committee time if required).
Applications placed in category 'B' will be assessed to place them in either category ‘A’ or ‘C.’
This can either be done based on the colleagues' feedback or after Video conferencing with the
candidate.
The SCC and CFSC may review the classification of applications at any stage of the process. In
case of disagreements on the classification, CFSC will decide the suitability of the application
for further processing.
The applications in various categories will be processed in the following way:
Category ‘A’ Applications
i. The DSCM will ensure that the application is complete in all respects.
ii. The DSCM will schedule a video-interaction (erstwhile “Skype Session”) session with
the candidate as soon as possible in consultation with the SCC, and Chairman, FSC.
iii. The DSCM, PIC-FA and all faculty members of the concerned discipline(s) are
expected to be present during the video interaction. The purpose of the video

Faculty Affairs Advisory 04 (Version 3.0, September 2021) Page 2

interaction is to judge the candidate’s general attitude and communication skills as
well as to assess his/her teaching interests and clarity on future research plans.
iv. The DSCM sends requests for reference letters through the Institute Management
System (IMS) portal if the feedback based on the video interaction is positive.
v. If the reference letters and feedback based on the video interaction are positive, the
DSCM and Chairman FSC will finalize the date of the visit of the candidate at the
earliest.
Category ‘B’ Applications
i. The applications will be assessed with the intention of placing them in either category
‘A’ or ‘C’.
ii. The DSCM will ensure that the application is complete in all respects.
iii. The DSCM collates feedback from faculty members of the concerned discipline(s),
Chairman FSC, and PIC-FA.
iv. If the overall feedback is positive for the applicant to be placed in category ‘A,’ DSCM
will finalize the date of the video interaction after discussing with Chairman FSC and
PIC-FA on priority.
v. The DSCM sends requests for reference letters through the Institute Management
System (IMS) portal if the feedback based on the video interaction is positive.
vi. If the reference letters and feedback based on the video-interaction session are
positive, the DSCM and Chairperson FSC to finalize the date of the visit of the
candidate after checking the availability of the SCC, PIC-FA, and the Director.

Category ‘C’ Applications
These applications need not be pursued further at this time for consideration by the Standing
Committee. These will be processed in the usual manner before the Selection Committee

meeting. The SCC will review the closed cases (category ‘C’ applications). The CFSC and PIC-
FA may review the classification of applications at any stage of the process. In case of

disagreements on the classification, CFSC will decide the suitability of the application for further
processing.

Scheduling Video-conferencing:
Once DSCM identifies the pool of 4-5 candidates for video conferencing, they will send an email
to PIC-FA (with a copy to CFSC and SCC) to schedule the video conferencing. In the case of

exceptional candidates, scheduling of video conferencing can be expedited after consulting PIC-
FA. Video-conferencing of such candidates can be scheduled without identifying the pool.

Post-video-conferencing:
Comments on Video-conferencing forms should be detailed with a clear articulation of the
reasoning behind the final decision. For example, due attention should be paid to the
applications belonging to reserved categories and appropriate relaxations in age should be
considered for the reserved category candidates. Similarly, the reason for closure should be
commensurate with the comments made in various sections of the video-conferencing form.

76,AVAILABILITY OF SOFT ADVANCE TO NEW FACULTY,Faculty Affairs Advisories,AVAILABILITY OF SOFT ADVANCE TO NEW FACULTY,"AVAILABILITY OF SOFT ADVANCE TO NEW FACULTY
(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 4th meeting held on 3rd September 2011)
As per Govt. of India norms, a regular employee of the Institute may avail of a number of loans
from the Institute: for house building, conveyance, and the like. Usually, such loans have a long
repayment period and the interest is not compounded, turning these into rather soft loans. Many
of our new faculty colleagues are not eligible for these loans because (a) those without three
year experience must remain on contract for three years as Assistant Professor (Contract), and
(b) many are recruited on an initial contract of two years through the Standing Committee.
It was therefore decided that an interest-free soft advance of Rs 2 lakhs be made available to
the new faculty members. The amount will be recovered from salary over a period of 20 months,
or for the remaining period of contract (in case of faculty on contract), whichever happens to be
first. This advance is meant to help the new faculty members to comfortably incur initial
establishment expenditures in setting up the house and in purchase of conveyance.",
77,SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP FOR FACULTY,Faculty Affairs Advisories,SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP FOR FACULTY,"SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP FOR FACULTY

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 4th meeting held on 3rd September 2011)
A. Objectives:
1. To encourage faculty to spend considerable parts of summer in the campus engaged in
intense research.
2. To encourage faculty to actively seek external funding for their research.
3. To encourage and reward (financially) the faculty (and other academic staff) for good
research.
4. To encourage collaborative research amongst faculty of same and different disciplines of
the Institute as none shall have teaching load during summer.
B. The Scheme
1. The Fellowships will be awarded to carry out research at IITGN during summer break. At
least two months (60 days), preferably without break, should be devoted to the
Fellowship work. However, it is understood that some faculty members may need to
undertake a reasonable amount of travel for official or semi-official purposes during the
summer such as attending conferences, site visits for consulting projects, filed work for
research, expert committees etc., and such periods will be counted within the 60 days of
Fellowship period.
2. The maximum Fellowship amount will be equal to the basic pay plus dearness allowance
(excluding the transport allowance and the HRA) of the faculty member as of June 1 of
the year, and payable for a period of two months, subject to funds availability as outlined
below.
3. 25% of the total overheads charged to the externally funded research projects of the
concerned faculty member will be available to him/her for covering the Summer
Fellowship and other professional expenses; this account will be named as Professional
Development Account (PDA) and will be kept separate from the Rs 1 Lakh per year
currently allowed to the faculty from MHRD funds for professional development as per
sixth pay commission; the latter will be termed as Central Professional Development
Account (CPDA). The PDA amount will be cumulative and can be carried forward to the
future years, but the Institute will not credit any interest to any funds carried forward.
Considering that the faculty is allowed to earn honorarium from consulting projects and
continuing education programmes, no part of overheads from these will be transferred to
the PDA.
4. Half the sanctioned Fellowship amount can be charged to the PDA, subject to availability
of funds in PDA. The amount charged to the PDA will be matched equally from the
donations and endowment interest, if available. Otherwise, payment of the entire
Fellowship can be made from the PDA.
5. An option will be available to the faculty members individually or jointly, to submit a

Faculty Affairs Advisory 06(Version 1.0, July 2012) Page 2
formal research proposal to the Institute explaining clearly the research work they will
like to carry out for at least 60 days of summer break under the Fellowship. Such
proposals will be examined by the Institute Standing Committee which may obtain
review reports from domain experts. If such a proposal is approved, the Institute will
provide Fellowship amounting to 50% of basic pay and dearness allowance (as on 1st
June of the year) from the donations/endowment, for a period of two months, without
requiring the matching amount from PDA. This provision will be particularly useful for
faculty members working in areas where sponsored research projects do not provide

sufficient overheads etc. Such a proposal should be submitted with the Dean/Professor-
in-charge, R&D before 1st

of February of the corresponding year.

6. It is expected that the work carried out under the Fellowship through the “proposal route”
will seed work that will eventually result in scholarly publications or technology
development. All those who avail any funds for Summer Research through the research
proposal route, must submit a report not later than October 31 of the same year. This
report will be archived for future reference in consideration by the Institute for
subsequent funding through the “proposal route”.
C. Illustrations: To better illustrate the scheme, some instances are summarized :
a) A typical faculty member having plenty of projects will charge one month of
Fellowship amount from PDA and an equal amount from the
donations/endowment. The only expectations Institute will have from such a
person is that he/she must spend two months of summer doing research at the
Institute. Such a person need not write any research proposal.
b) If a faculty member has limited external funds and can charge only 20 days of
Summer Fellowship to the PDA, the donation/endowment will provide another 20
days of Summer Fellowship. However, in this instance also, the faculty member
must devote a minimum of 60 days to the Fellowship. Such a faculty member
need not write any research proposal to the Institute.
c) The faculty member mentioned in b) above may choose to write a research
proposal to the Institute, and if such a proposal is approved , he/she may avail 20
days of Summer Fellowship from PDA and 30 days from the
donation/endowment.
d) A faculty member having no sponsored projects or having no overheads for PDA,
may avail only one month of Summer Fellowship amount from the
donation/endowment divided equally over two months, upon successful
submission of the research proposal. In this instance too, the faculty must spend
a minimum of 60 days of summer break on research at the Institute.
e) As the faculty shall be carrying out research work for at least 60 days of summer
break, the concerned person shall be on official duty at the Institute during this
period and thus provision of his/her annual vacation of 60 days or earned leave
in lieu thereof, remains unaffected.",
78,SCHOLARS-IN-RESIDENCE PROGRAMME,Faculty Affairs Advisories,SCHOLARS-IN-RESIDENCE PROGRAMME,"SCHOLARS-IN-RESIDENCE PROGRAMME

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 7th meeting held on 23rd June 2012)
IIT Gandhinagar would like to establish a Scholars-in-Residence Scheme which will lead to yet
another type of scholarly activity at the Institute. Under this scheme, personnel with excellent /
outstanding track record as Teachers/ Researchers/Scholars will be invited to spend varying
periods [from one month to a year] at IIT Gandhinagar, with a view to provide an ambience which
promotes the spirit of inquiry, research and scholarship which the students, staff and faculty can
partake.
Eminent scholars from India or aboard, hosted under this scheme, could utilize the period in
residence to
 prepare/complete manuscripts of books/monographs
 seed/nucleate research ideas, and, develop them further in collaboration with IITGn faculty
 prepare collaborative research proposals with IITGn faculty as partners
 conduct workshops/plan international conferences
 help develop curricula for courses/programmes in emerging areas.
Scholars-in-Residence will be expected to interact with the faculty and students of IITGn – in a
manner consistent with the key objectives and activities targeted for the tenure, and share their work
in progress at Institutional Seminars/public lectures. They would be expected to acknowledge the
support extended by IITGn in their dissemination endeavours – invited
lecturers/reports/publications/research proposals.
Scholars-in-Residence would be provided with
 to and fro air fare by economy class as per Institutional norms
 rent free semi-furnished accommodation for the tenure
 OPD facilities available to faculty of IITGn
 office space and access to Library facilities, and
 an honorarium
Selection of Scholars under this scheme would be carried out by the Standing Committee on faculty
affairs which will examine nominations and proposals in the light of
 the significance and potential impact of the visitor
 the clarity of objectives and schedule of activities
 the likely output, and plans for dissemination of the results
The Standing Committee will also decide on the honorarium to be offered depending on expected
involvement. At the present time, it is expected to range from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 30,000 per week.
However, the range of honorarium may be revised from time to time by the Standing Committee. The
Standing Committee may also in exceptional cases approve proposals where the visitor can spend

Faculty Affairs Advisory 07 (Version 1.0, July 2012) Page 2
less than one month at IITGN.The Committee may also choose to designate a visitor as
“Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence”.
The scheme will be reviewed after five years operating experience.",
79,FACULTY DEVELOPMENT PLAN OF THE INSTITUTE,Faculty Affairs Advisories,FACULTY DEVELOPMENT PLAN OF THE INSTITUTE,"FACULTY DEVELOPMENT PLAN OF THE INSTITUTE
(As approved by Board of Governors in its first meeting held on 18th December 2009)
Faculty is the backbone of any academic institute. Faculty helps students acquire knowledge in
their specific subjects as well as develop innovative approaches to issues of practical
importance through class-room teaching and out-of-the-class discussions. Faculty creates
knowledge through research and, in the process trains graduate students (sometimes
undergraduate students as well) in research and development activities. Character of the
institute is defined and determined by the quality of its graduates when they go out in the field. It
is a gradual process with critical inputs from the faculty. To shape the envisioned future of
IITGN, it is critical to recruit and retain outstanding faculty and continue obtaining their top
performance during their stay.
Well established institutes attract faculty commensurate with their name and track record. Some
of the factors that attract the best faculty candidates are the quality of students, laboratories and
research facilities, strength of Masters and Doctoral programmes, excellence in certain
academic areas, potential for recognition of good work through financial
and other incentives, and the quality of existing faculty and researchers. Academic and other
freedom is always expected in academic institutes.
IITGN has yet to establish its traditions and credentials. However, IITGN carries the name of
an IIT and is expected to provide excellence at the level of older IITs and beyond. Our
admission process assures an outstanding quality of undergraduate students who are envy
of any institute in the world. Financial backing of the Government of India assures speedy
development of laboratories and infrastructure. Academic freedom to faculty members in
pursuing and growing their envisioned areas can be guaranteed. We should not and cannot
afford to compromise on the quality of faculty at this stage under the exigency of teaching
classes. A lower quality faculty will not only adversely affect our pursuit of excellence during
their (sometimes long) stay, but also hamper our ability to attract good quality faculty in the
future. We have to approach our recruitment process by highlighting our strengths and coming
up with novel schemes to overcome our limitations being a new institute.
In view of our commitment to excellence, the followings actions are proposed for the short term
or are already being undertaken towards faculty recruitment, retention and development. This
document will be periodically updated and will guide us in all faculty matters.
1. Communication: Communication and publicity is the key to attract faculty. We have to reach
the potential faculty candidates in as large a number as possible and encourage them to
consider making a career at our institute. With this in view, the Institute has been focusing on
its web site, has initiated a quarterly newsletter (~3000 copies being mailed; including to all
faculty members of all IITs), is in the process of developing strong mailing lists of top
academics and industrialists, and has been successfully seeking regular press coverage. On
his two trips to US, the Director visited several universities (Stanford, Caltech, University of
California Los Angeles, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, Northwestern University,
and State University of New York Buffalo) where he met and addressed Indian graduate and
post-doctoral students and elaborated on the advantages of joining IITGN. This has resulted
in some of them applying for faculty positions to our Institute.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 08 (Version 1.0, July 2012) Page 2
2. Recognition and Financial Incentives: As an additional means of attracting outstanding
faculty, provision should be made for recognition and financial incentive. At most of the
renowned institutes, including several older IITs, accomplishments of faculty members are
often recognized by offering them prestigious “Chaired” positions. We must create similar
“Chaired” positions at IITGN. These “Chaired” positions will also carry additional honorarium
over and above the Govt-mandated salary. At IITGN, there is also a need to create Research
Fellowships for outstanding young faculty on the lines similar to the “Chaired” positions for
established faculty members. These fellowships will not only provide recognition and financial
incentives but also accelerate their professional growth. Additional funds for the honoraria
have to be raised from private donations and endowments.
3. Recruitment Quality: A good faculty candidate would like to go to a place having a better
quality of existing faculty. In the long term interest of the Institute, we intend to not only be
quite careful in ensuring the quality of faculty we hire, but also be strict in clearing the
probation of faculty members currently on its rolls. In fact, we should seriously consider
increasing the probation period of regular faculty to two years unlike the general practice in
the IIT system for one-year probation which is not always sufficient to judge true potential or
weakness of a young colleague.
4. Recruitment Process and Strategy: In July 2009, faculty recruitment process was moved to
IITGN and ~650 applications received since are currently being processed. Since IITGN does
not have domain expertise in many areas, a 2-tier short-listing process has been developed
(and documented) to utilize the expertise of senior colleagues at IIT Bombay and elsewhere.
While efforts are being made to quickly complete this round of selections, so as not to lose
exceptionally good candidates contract appointments through “standing committee” will be
offered where appropriate without waiting for selection committee meeting. Efforts are also
being made to bring some mid-career distinguished faculty to IITGN. Considering that group
research is critical to making an impact in a discipline, we may also make several offers
simultaneously in a research area in order to create viable a group.
5. Recruitment Strategy in “Other” Disciplines: Currently, IITGN has academic programmes
in a few disciplines only, but it will eventually start several other disciplines such as
Computer Science and Engineering, Civil Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering,
Biosciences and Bioengineering, etc. IITGN Academic Council has decided to start recruiting
faculty and simultaneously start Doctoral programmes in all these areas, so that faculty
members can initially start their research work through Doctoral students and develop
laboratories and other research facilities. As faculty grows in a discipline, Masters and
Bachelors programmes will be started in a phased manner and in that sequence. Therefore,
the Institute will initially focus on research-oriented faculty recruitment and thus be able to
develop faculty in these areas over a longer time period. This plan is now in place and the
Institute is currently processing faculty applications in all such areas.
6. Visiting Professors: IIT GN intends to be liberal in bringing short-term faculty members to
help run the Institute, both for teaching and developing the laboratories, as well as for
institution building. This is important to provide quality teaching to our students, and in
mentoring of our younger faculty. Two approaches are being taken in the Institute towards
achieving this.
a. Efforts are being made to bring mid-career faculty members from other academic
institutions in the country. Already, IIT Bombay has been contributing towards this by

Faculty Affairs Advisory 08 (Version 1.0, July 2012) Page 3
sending their faculty members for a semester, and in one case for a longer duration
(Prof Yajnik has been with us since July 2008). We were also able to get Prof Dhiren
Patel of Computer Science Department at NIT Surat to join us as Visiting Professor for
a year starting in July 2009.
b. Efforts are also being made to bring superannuated faculty members of IITs and other
good institutions. We have received a fair amount of success in this regard and several
such professors who retired from IITB have joined us, one retired professor of IIT Kanpur
(currently settled in US) will join us shortly, and we are in discussions with some others.
7. Pioneer Leadership Programme: Board of Governors of IIT Bombay had earlier decided
liberal terms for IITB faculty assisting the setting up of IITGN. In addition to their full salary,
additional allowance of 50% of basic pay, furnished rent-free accommodation at IITGN, and
air fare for travel once a month between Mumbai and Gandhinagar are provided. This
provision has been very beneficial to IITGN programmes in utilizing services of experienced
IITB faculty members. In order to attract mid-career faculty members of other Institutions in
the country to move to IITGN for a limited period ranging from a semester to several years,
Chairman of the Board of Governors has already approved a proposal to offer conditions
similar to those offered to IITB faculty. However, additional cash allowance paid to faculty
other than that from IIT Bombay has to be charged to the donations and endowment. Efforts
are now being made to raise the requisite money.
8. Research Proposals: Research work carried out by faculty members distinguishes IITs from
other engineering colleges. Besides publicity through publication of research papers and
training research students, research activities improve quality of teaching, help develop
laboratories and other facilities. Therefore, IITGN supports the research of its faculty
members within its limited means. However, the Institute strongly encourages its faculty
members to obtain additional research funds from outside agencies, and will provide all
support to faculty members in developing and submitting research proposals to various
funding agencies. Sponsored research projects afford greater flexibility and freedom to
faculty members in their research activities, provides peer review comments on their ideas,
and helps them gain visibility at national and international levels.
9. Research Space: Our current location places a significant limitation on the research space
we can provide to our faculty. While we are making an optimal use of the space available, we
need to go beyond. Two options are being considered: a) Renting a floor of a commercial
building near the campus with an area of about 500 sq m, and b) Construction of about 1,000
sq m of pre-engineered workshop-type shed within the VGEC Campus at the cost of IITGN,
which can be subdivided into smaller units and allocated for various purposes.
10. International Travel Support: Participation in international conferences and meetings is an
important avenue for professional growth of faculty members, particularly for keeping pace
with research being done at other places and futuristic trends. Therefore, we should
encourage faculty members to participate in international conferences and provide travel and
other support for the same. IITGN can provide limited funds for international travel through
the MHRD grants. Faculty members can approach other agencies like DST for international
travel support. We must also make efforts to raise private funds for international travel and
other activities that encourage and support our pursuit of excellence. Several older IITs are
already doing so.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 08 (Version 1.0, July 2012) Page 4
11. International Exposure: IITGN must encourage its faculty members to gain working
experience in international environment. Those of our faculty members who have spent less
than six months carrying out studies or research in a technologically advanced country will be
encouraged to seek one-year international experience. They will be encouraged to apply for
the fellowships available through Govt. of India, such as the BOYSCAST Fellowship and the
Indo-US Science and Technology Fellowship, or seek funding opportunities from some
university or research organization overseas. In some cases, we may even utilize our own
resources through the MHRD grants/private donations to facilitate them obtain such an
experience. We may also need to be liberal and make exceptions in granting leave of
absence to the faculty for this purpose. It is best if they obtain such experience early in their
career before they are deeply involved with their PhD students and other research projects.
12. Summer Industrial Experience: Many younger faculty colleagues will benefit from working
with design and development unit of an industry during the summer months. This can be a
very useful experience for a faculty member in obtaining industrial perspective and to fine
tune his teaching and research. IITGN will encourage such engagements by formally
approaching the concerned industries on behalf of interested faculty members and where
appropriate will extend required administrative and financial support.
13. Masters Programmes: Masters programmes (MTech in engineering disciplines and MSc in
sciences) enable faculty members to develop and teach post-graduate courses in their areas
of expertise, and carry out research through Masters projects. Many of our Masters students
may stay on for a doctoral degree, and hence, provide better research scholars to our faculty
members. Therefore, Masters programmes are extremely beneficial for professional
development and growth of faculty members. With this in mind, IITGN intends to start
Masters programmes as soon as it is in a position to do so, with respect to its faculty strength
in different disciplines.
14. Joint Doctorate with Academics from Elsewhere: Considering our initial limitations in
terms of research laboratories, IITGN is encouraging its faculty members to undertake PhD
supervision jointly with academics elsewhere who may have strong research infrastructure.
15. Engagement of Senior External Academics: IITGN will engage distinguished academics
from around the country and overseas who will advise, guide and mentor the faculty. Already,
Professor S P Sukhatme (former Director, IIT Bombay) and Prof J B Joshi (former Director,
Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai) are engaged with us as Distinguished Honorary
Professors. Institute has also set up an “Academic Consultative Group” for Chemical
Engineering as a facilitation initiative for the benefit of our young faculty. Several more
Advisory Committees will be formed both at the Department/Discipline and the Institute levels
wherein the committee members will advise and guide the Institute and take the ownership of
its short-term targets. The Institute intends to have fairly liberal budget on this head, to
enable attractive terms and monetary compensation to such advisory committee members.
16. International Partnerships: IITGN has benefitted enormously with the special relationship it
shares with IIT Bombay. It now plans to forge strong relationships with several willing and
enthusiastic universities worldwide with whom we would have active exchanges of faculty
and students, and undertake joint projects. The Provost and Executive Vice President of
SUNY Buffalo Professor Satish Tripathi will visit IITGN in December 2009 and several other
senior academics from US universities have visited us in recent months or are scheduled to
visit us shortly to discuss mutual collaborations and activities, e.g., Prof Nitish Thakor of
Johns Hopkins, Prof Pratim Biswas of University of Washington St Louis, and Prof Kishore

Faculty Affairs Advisory 08 (Version 1.0, July 2012) Page 5
Trivedi of Duke University. Besides the US, IITGN will also develop similar relationships with
some European and Indian universities / research centres.
17. Periodic Assessment and Feedback System: IITGN has now initiated a system wherein all
faculty members fill up a self–assessment form at the end of an academic year. This will
enable the Institute to evaluate the effectiveness of its faculty, and undertake any mid-course
corrections in its policies on faculty matters. Further, it will enable the Institute to provide
constructive feedback to the concerned faculty. On the part of faculty, this system will keep
them aware of their own performance and output. Institute has also set up a system for
quarterly report from younger faculty who are either on probation or on contact.",

Research Fellowships at the rate of Rs 15,000/- per month for new / young faculty from donor
funds. The Senate approved the following modalities for implementation of the Research
Fellowships:
1) At the time of faculty recruitments, advice of the Selection Committee (or the Standing
Committee) be sought and wherever the Committee considers appropriate, the Fellowship be
offered to the concerned persons after obtaining approval of the Chairman of the Board of
Governors.
2) All the faculty members who join the Institute be given periodic opportunities to submit

research proposals to be funded internally by IIT Gandhinagar. Such proposals be peer-
reviewed by external experts and a final view be taken by a Standing Committee of the

Institute on funding of such proposals.
3) Some of the faculty members who were not awarded Research Fellowships at the time of
selection, but whose research is considered to be of very high caliber and whose
performance in the Institute is considered exemplary, be offered Research Fellowships on
recommendation of the Standing Committee and approval of the Chairman of Board of
Governors.
4) In all cases, the Fellowships be awarded for a period of three years, but be renewed on an
annual basis depending on the progress of the incumbent towards his/her research, and
availability of funds.
5) The incumbent should be not more than 40 years of age at the time of award of this
Fellowship. The incumbent will be eligible for one more term of three years, depending on
performance; i.e., one can avail of the Fellowship for a maximum period of six years.
6) The incumbent will be expected to send an annual report to the donor on his/her research
activities in a format prescribed by the Institute from time to time. The report shall be sent
through the official channels of the Institute; failure to submit such a report in a timely manner
should lead to discontinuation of the Fellowship.
7) The Chairman is authorized by Senate to finalize a suitable title for such fellowships in
consultation with the respective donors.
The Board in its 7th meeting held on 23 June 2012 approved enhancement of the Research
Fellowship for new/young faculty members in slabs of Rs. 15,000/- p.m. and Rs.25,000/- p.m.
with option of no fellowship that is in operation at lITGN. The Board also recalled the Young
Leader Fellowship for faculty approved in the 3rd meeting and approved that the honorarium for
the same may also be either Rs. 15,000/- p.m. or Rs. 25,000/- on a case by case basis. The
Board also approved the proposal for enhancing the amount of honorarium for Faculty Chair to
Rs. 50,000/- p.m. from the present Rs. 25,000/- p.m.
Further, the Board in its 26th meeting held on 01 March 2019 has approved the following
enhancement in the Faculty Research Fellowship and honorarium for Faculty Chairs for new
offers.
a) Revision of faculty Research Fellowship slabs to Rs. 25,000/- and Rs. 40,000/- per month
(from the existing slabs of Rs. 15,000/- and Rs. 25,000/-, respectively).
b) Rates of Faculty Chair to be in the range of Rs. 50,000/- to Rs. 1,00,000/- per month (from
the existing rate of Rs. 50,000/- per month).",

(The scheme was approved the Board of Governors in its second meeting held on 19th September
2010, the guidelines adopted by Senate in its eight meeting held on 10th September 2011 and
revised by the Board of Governors in its 30th meeting held on 17 December 2020)

In addition to “Chaired” Positions for experienced faculty members and “Research
Fellowships” for young faculty members with promise of outstanding research, it is proposed
to set up excellence awards for faculty members for outstanding contributions in each of the
categories of teaching, research, institution building, and outreach (service to the profession,
e.g., through committee work, consulting and continuing education). For this purpose, the
Institute proposes to create four separate, “Outstanding Contribution” awards to be given at
the end of each academic year to the deserving faculty; Teachers’ Day celebration on
September 5 every year may be a very appropriate occasion for honouring the faculty. The
recognition of their efforts will foster increased motivation among the faculty members to
pursue and implement ideas in the fields of their passion.
These awards will carry a certificate of felicitation and a financial reward of Rs 1,00,000/-. In
addition, a sum of Rs 1,00,000/- will be contributed to the faculty member’s Professional
Development Fund to allow the faculty member to grow further and explore novel ideas.
In the proposed structure of the award, a faculty member can only win an award in any one of
the four categories in one academic year. He / she may however be considered for any
number of categories. In addition, once a faculty member has won the award in a particular
category, he/she will not be eligible for the award in the same category for the next three
years.
For these awards to be effective means of encouraging excellence, the selection process
must be transparent and above board. The precise mechanism for setting the criteria and
evaluation of the award will be decided by the Academic Senate at IITGN in consultation with
the faculty and periodically revised in view of experience gained. It is understood that these
awards will be based on actual contributions carried out at IITGN, and admittedly, lasting
contributions require a longer time scale to measure, at least two years. Hence, the Senate
may choose to start only with a few awards in the beginning, say Excellence in Teaching
Award and the Excellence in Research Award.
Norms for Excellence in Teaching Award
 Excellence in Teaching Award will be open to all the regular faculty members who have
completed at least two years of teaching at IIT Gandhinagar and have contributed to

be restricted to 2 courses.
 A weighted average of the overall course evaluation by the students feed-back will be
considered as cut-off parameters for a faculty member to become eligible for
consideration for Excellence in Teaching Award. Suggested cut-off criterion at present
is: a weighted average of the overall course evaluation 3.20 (minimum) on the scale of
4.00. For this purpose, the course evaluation data of only those courses will be
considered for which feedback has been received from at least 40% of the students

, 13th, and 16th meetings)
1. The implementation of the provision of Cumulative Professional Development Allowance
(CPDA) as per Sixth Pay Commission was approved by the Board of Governors in its
1
st meeting held on 18 December 2009. The approved scheme is as follows:
1.1 A Cumulative Professional Development Allowance (CPDA) of Rs 1,00,000 (Rs One
Lakh) per year is made available to faculty members which can be used for travel to
attend meetings in India and overseas, purchase of equipment and books, membership
of professional societies, and other contingencies.
1.2 A notional account will be created and maintained for every faculty member to manage
the Professional Development Allowance. At the beginning of a financial year, Rs. 1 lakh
will be credited to this account. All eligible expenses by the concerned faculty will be
debited to this account. However, the accumulated amount into this account will not be
allowed to exceed Rs 3 lakhs. For instance, if on 31st March an amount of Rs 2.5 lakh is
available as a credit, on April 1st only a sum of Rs 0.5 lakh will be credited to the
account.
1.3 Expenses incurred by the faculty member for his/her professional development will be
reimbursed against receipts upto the maximum of credit available in his/her notional
account. In exceptional situations, the Director may allow the balance in this account to
go upto minus Rs 50,000, which shall be duly adjusted in the next year. Such a situation
may arise, for instance, in case of international travel by a faculty member.
1.4 When a faculty member first joins the Institute, the amount to be credited to his/her
account will be prorated as per period of service in that financial year. For instance, if a
person joins on January 1st, a sum of Rs 25,000 will be credited to his/her account upon
joining (accounting year of the Institute is from April 1st of the current year to March 31st
of the next year).
1.5 The CPDA will also be applicable for faculty members on contract and the visiting faculty
provided that (a) the faculty member is working full-time with the Institute, and (b) his/her
expected stay with the Institute is of one year or longer duration.
2. The Board in its fourth meeting held on 03 September 2011 approved a scheme of
Professional Development Account (PDA) in the R&D accounts for every faculty
member.
The PDA comprises 25% of the total overhead charged to the externally funded research
projects of the concerned faculty member. The amount in PDA is available to him/her for
covering various professional expenses. The PDA amount is cumulative and can be carried
forward to future years without any limits.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 13 (Version 4.0, June 2015) Page 2 of 2
3. For efficient processing and ease in monitoring of the CPDA and the PDA accounts,
the Board in its 8th meeting held on 3rd December 2012, approved the following norms:
3.1 Both CPDA and PDA be managed through R&D accounts.
3.2 Ledger pages for every faculty be opened to show details of CPDA and PDA
separately.
3.3 At beginning of the financial year, the CPDA amount of Rs one lac per faculty be
transferred from the Main Account to the R&D account for all faculty members on roll
after making adjustment for those who left or joined during the preceding year.
4. The Board in its 13th meeting held on 14 March 2014, approved the following norms
with regard to procurement of items from CPDA and PDA:
The fund available under CPDA/PDA are to be utilized by the faculty member towards his/her
professional development. This may include expenses towards participation in conferences and
visits of academic nature as well as for procurement of items like consumables, computer, laptop,
tablets, cell phone, books etc. As many of these items procured from CPDA/PDA are of small
book value and are part of limited time asset:
4.1 A separate Central Register will be created.
4.2 All items costing more than Rs. 50,000/- will be entered in this Central Register.
4.3 Items will be assumed to have very little or negligible disposal value at the end of 3 years.
4.4 However, if he/she leaves the Institute before such items are three years old, he/she
may keep the item by paying either 10% of the original purchase value or the
depreciated value of the item, whichever is less.
5. The board in its 16th meeting held on 21 April 2015, approved the following norms with
regard to providing matching funds to Professional Development Account of faculty
for certain transfers
For some of the institute activities, such as participation in JEE, GATE and such other
examinations, the faculty is provided honorarium. Also, for teaching in the summer term, the
Institute provides some honorarium. These amounts are quite modest and in many instances
the concerned faculty member may prefer not to draw the honorarium but to utilize the
amount towards their professional activities. These activities take away from faculty their
research time or personal time but these activities are critical for the Institute. Hence, to
encourage participation of faculty in such activities, the Board approved that whenever the
concerned person chooses to divert such amounts to their Professional Development Account
(PDA), the Institute will also transfer a matching amount to PDA; the amount thus incurred will
be charged to the R&D Fund of the Institute.",

(As approved by the BoG in its first meeting held on 18 December 2009 and
revised in 11th meeting held on 11 August 2013 and 14th meeting held on 02 August 2014)

The Board of Governors in its first meeting had recognized the need to provide to young
faculty members (those who have note already studied or worked in a technologically
advanced country) an international exposure early in the career, even without waiting for
confirmation in service. The Board had approved following norms for exceptions for
academic leave to address this need with the provision that these be reviewed periodically
and suitably modified in light of the experience gained:
(i) Faculty eligible for exceptions must:

a. Have served the Institute at least for a semester.

b. Have not studied or worked for more than a year in a technologically-
advanced nation overseas.

c. Be seeking leave to avail an opportunity to carry out research in reputed
academic/ research institutions in a technologically advanced country.
(ii) Maximum duration of such a leave will be one academic year (plus summer or winter
vacation as the case may be). For instance: a) A person may be allowed to go in May
and return the next year in July (without being absent for more than two semesters),
and b) A faculty member going in October must return by July next year (so as not to be
absent for more than two semesters). However, the Standing Committee may increase
the maximum duration of such a leave to two years on a case-by-case basis.
(iii) If a faculty member has lined up funding on his/her own accord from the host institute
and wishes to avail the opportunity at no cost to the Institute, he/she will be granted
special leave (without pay and allowances). Such leave period will be eligible for
reckoning as qualifying period of service for all other benefits, including increments.
(iv) Institute will also encourage faculty members to apply for Government of India
sponsored opportunities such as the BOYSCAST Fellowship and the Indo-US Science
and Technology Fellowship. Such opportunities require that the Institute cover the entire
salary during the period of fellowship. Faculty under this category would be required to
serve the Institute for a period of three years upon return and will sign a bond to that
effect. Their salary for the leave period would be paid in thirty six monthly installments
after they rejoin the Institute. If the concerned faculty is being supported through
donations raised by the Institute, the same arrangement will hold.
(v) In case the concerned faculty member has not yet cleared probation, the leave period
will not count towards probation period. His/her interrupted probation period will be
resumed upon return.
The above arrangement will be reviewed periodically (at an interval of not more than two
years) and suitably modified in light of the experience gained.",

FUND

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its ninth meeting held on 28th March 2013)
Considering its aspirational research agenda, the Institute must encourage very active
participation of its faculty members in international activities. Our faculty colleagues should be
able to present their work to a larger international audience and develop collaborative research.
We must recognize that most of our faculty members are relatively young in their career at
present and will take some time to setup their research facilities and to have some tangible
outputs for a number of publications. Hence, the need for additional encouragement and
facilitation is most critical at this juncture.
The following norms have been arrived at with the above context in mind. It is understood that
these norms will be reviewed and revised periodically to meet the needs of changed
circumstances as the Institute grows and as the experience is gained on implementation of this
scheme.
1. A career faculty member of the Institute who has published at least two journal papers
during the two calendar years prior to the date of event/activity will be eligible for travel
support under this scheme. Those journal papers must be:
(a) Published in a journal listed on the ISI Web of Science.
(b) Must list the affiliation of the concerned faculty member as IIT Gandhinagar in
an unambiguous manner.

2. In some areas (such as humanities and social sciences), it may be more appropriate for
the faculty members to publish their research elsewhere (and not in the journals listed on
ISI Web of Science). Should a faculty member feel that his/her work published
elsewhere should be considered for the travel support, he/ she may seek a case-by-case
exemption from the requirement of clause 1(a) above.
3. This financial assistance can support the expenses related to visas, conference
registration fee, air tickets, travel insurance and per diem for attending a conference/
workshop/ meeting. The assistance can also be provided for collaborative research
activity.
4. The amount to be provided by way of financial support under this scheme will be subject
to ceiling of Rs. 1.00 lakh per year. The Dean/Professor-in-charge (Faculty Affairs) will
consider the request and make a recommendation to the Director for approval.
5. In addition to the above, Standing Committee (on faculty affairs) may approve the
following travel assistance on merit of the case:
(a) Faculty members who work in theoretical areas but with very active research
profile may be granted an additional support of upto Rs 1.00 lakh in a year. The
criteria for theoretical areas include (i) where it is difficult to seek significant
external sponsored research funds, and (ii) where faculty member does not seek
significant laboratory / computational resources from the Institute for his/her
research.
(b) Faculty members deeply engaged in “institution building” activity may be
provided an additional support to the extent of Rs 1.00 lakh in a year. Further, in
their case, the requirement of para 1 may be relaxed if deemed appropriate by
the Standing Committee.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 15 (Version 3.0, January 2014) Page 2
6. Expenditure on this scheme will be covered from the “Excellence Funds” as approved by
the Board of Governors from time to time, such as donations, interest income of the
endowment, and overheads and savings of the projects.
7. The scheme is proposed to be implemented with immediate effect.",

OTHER SIMILAR FELLOWSHIPS

(As approved by Board of Governors in its eighth meeting held on 3rd December 2012)
Different Departments/Ministries of Government of India (such as Department of Science
and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, etc) have a number of schemes for awarding
Fellowships to faculty and potential-faculty candidates with excellent credentials. Several
benefits accrue when faculty members apply and seek such opportunities: a) It enables
faculty to compete which builds up their confidence and in case of success, it adds to their
resume, b) a number of such Fellowships being awarded to our faculty will add to prestige of
the Institute, and c) Institute may save some money in the salary head. Hence, it is important
for the Institute to create a conducive environment that encourages recipients of such
Fellowships and ensures that they do not suffer any financial disadvantages by accepting
such a fellowship.
Some of the Fellowships (such as J C Bose Fellowship) provide a “top-up” amount to the
faculty members, over and above the regular salary that one continues to draw from his/her
parent institution. Such Fellowships will be managed as such. In case someone is receiving
a monthly honorarium through a Chair or an Excellence-in-Research Fellowship of the
Institute, the same will continue.
Some of the Fellowships (such as Ramanujan Fellowship) provide a monthly honorarium
comparable to the entry-level faculty salary. In case of such a Fellowship, two scenarios may
arise:
1. The person is not employed by the Institute as faculty member but IITGN agrees to
host him/ her under the Fellowship. In that case, all the conditions of the Fellowship
will be applied as such and IITGN will only provide the support for research and
professional activities as appropriate.
2. The person is already a faculty member of the Institute or subsequently gets selected
as a faculty member of the Institute. In such a case, the person will be treated as on
Institute rolls, and the financial norms will be as per the following:
a. If the Fellowship amount is lower than the IITGN salary (Basic Pay + Grade
Pay + DA), the person will receive Fellowship as per prescribed rate, plus
IITGN will pay a monthly honorarium equal to the difference of the two. If
Fellowship is higher, the person will draw only the Fellowship.
b. In addition, IITGN will pay all allowances and fringe benefits applicable to
faculty members such as HRA, Transport Allowance, Children’s Education
Allowance, LTC, Contribution to New Pension Scheme, Medical
Reimbursement, Communication charges, Professional Development
Allowance, etc, as per his/ her salary and entitlement at IITGN.
c. If the Fellowship has a provision of HRA, IITGN will not pay HRA. However, if
the HRA provided by the Fellowship is lower than the HRA entitlement as per
IITGN norms, the difference will be added as a monthly honorarium from
IITGN.",

(As approved by the BoG in its 13th meeting held on 14 March 2014)

The Board of Governors of the Institute in its 13th meeting held on 14 March 2014
approved the following mechanism for dual appointment of faculty members.
a) Faculty members will continue to be selected for specific discipline/ department.
b) The Standing Committee of the Institute for the faculty affairs can provide the
faculty, based on his/ her interest and merit, a joint association with another
discipline/ department for a given period (say five years).
c) This association can be reviewed every 5 years for further extension.
d) The faculty member may not get additional remuneration for this association but will
be expected to participate in teaching, research and service activities of both the
disciplines/ departments.
The Standing Committee on faculty affairs considered the above decision of the Board
and decided on the following implementation mechanism:
a) Applications be invited from those faculty members, who are interested in joint
appointments in other disciplines stating the proposed contributions in teaching
and research by a certain date (August 15, 2014 in the first instance).
b) Applications received for joint appointments be referred to the concerned

appointment as Associate Professors",Faculty Affairs Advisories,"Expectations from IIT Gandhinagar faculty for
appointment as Associate Professors","Expectations from IIT Gandhinagar faculty for
appointment as Associate Professors

Advancement in rank is a means to recognize and promote excellent scholarship by our
colleagues. In this document, expectations from IIT Gandhinagar faculty for appointment as
Associate Professors are outlined. The intent is to convey the high expectations the institute
places on its faculty members while maintaining the flexibility needed to accommodate the
diversity of disciplines in the institute.
To seek appointment at Associate Professor position, a faculty member at IIT Gandhinagar will
be expected to satisfy all of the criteria listed below:
1. Independent research capabilities
a. S/he must have demonstrated a sustained publication record in reputed journals
based on work done at IIT Gandhinagar. Within this, it is important to have at least
some publications that do not include one’s mentor (e.g., PhD or post-doc guide) as
a co-author. Similarly, it is important to have at least some publications that are not
co-authored with a large research team outside IIT Gandhinagar (nationally or
internationally). For disciplines in which other forms of publications (for example,
conference publications in case of Computer Science) are significantly valued,
publications at the best venues are expected.
b. In case of collaborative research, the individual research contributions should be
clearly outlined. These individual contributions will be appropriately factored in during
the assessment.
c. S/he must be active in guiding research students at PhD level, and possibly at
BTech/MTech/MSc/MA levels, as the case may be. At least one PhD student should
have completed his/her PhD under the faculty member’s guidance (or nearing
completion) with additional students in the pipeline. Further, s/he must have
successfully helped these student(s) publish their work (papers accepted for
publications can be counted towards this).
d. S/he must have been successful in bringing reasonable amounts of research funding
from external agencies as principal investigator. In exceptional cases, if the
candidate can demonstrate that his/her research requires no experimental or
computational resources or field-work that needs funds, this condition may be
waived.
e. In case of experimentalists, s/he should have developed appropriate research
facilities at IIT Gandhinagar.
f. The faculty member’s track record should indicate likelihood of continuing to remain
a productive researcher over the longer term.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 18 (version 2.0, June 2021) Page 2
g. The research evaluation will be carried out in the context of intellectual quality and
broad impact (or potential impact). It is noted that the number of publications are
secondary to the impact that they have on his/her field. Similarly, peer recognition for
research will be valued. It is also recognized that given the diversity of the faculty
and their specific areas of work, this criterion will have to be interpreted in that
context.
h. The faculty member is expected to have a clear vision and focus in his/her research
that is expected to make an impact in the years ahead.
2. Teaching capabilities and commitment
a. S/he should have successfully taught a range of courses, both at UG and PG levels,
with decent student feedback ratings. This should include at least 2 core/basic/large
courses. However, this may be relaxed somewhat for colleagues working in highly
interdisciplinary areas or areas not prevalent in IITGN’s degree programs.
b. Innovations in teaching, developing teaching materials, and teaching laboratories will
be particularly appreciated.
c. Engagement with students in curricular, co-curricular and extracurricular activities is
generally expected. Since teaching is not an activity restricted to the classroom
alone, advising and interactions with the students outside of class are also
recognized as important aspects of teaching excellence.
3. Commitment to service
a. S/he should have made direct, positive contribution to some Institution building
activities and outreach.
b. Exceptional leadership in service to the Institute provided by a faculty member would
be appropriately factored in assessment of research contributions.

In addition to the above expectations, the faculty member is expected to have maintained the
highest levels of ethical standards and their conduct with students/staff/faculty must have been
impeccable.
As the Institute grows, these expectations will go higher.",
90,ADVISORY ON WORK PLACE PRESENCE FOR FACULTY,Faculty Affairs Advisories,ADVISORY ON WORK PLACE PRESENCE FOR FACULTY,"ADVISORY ON WORK PLACE PRESENCE FOR FACULTY

The Schedule C of the Statutes of IIT Gandhinagar provides Conduct Rules applicable
to the employees of the Institute. As per the conduct rules, faculty members are
expected to maintain regular working hours and an appropriate presence in the Institute
premises. However, by nature of their job, faculty needs flexibility to function efficiently
and generally end up spending more than normal working hours. It therefore may not be
appropriate to prescribe rigid working hours for faculty. Accordingly, IITGN does not
impose strict office hours on faculty but expects faculty to use this flexibility in a
responsible manner. This advisory is meant to clarify further on the matter of scheduled
office hours and the presence of faculty in the Institute.
1. Faculty members are expected to use their discretion and ensure appropriate
presence in the Institute during normal working hours. On an average, a faculty
member is expected to spend at least 40 hours per week in the academic area.
2. If for whatever reason a faculty member is not able to come to the Institute
(academic area) on a working day, he/she must apply for appropriate leave. A
faculty member can avail leaves of different types. Also, the General
Administration Advisory No. 12 provides clarifications on some of the matters
related to leaves.
3. The leave shall always be applied for and sanctioned before it is taken except in
cases of emergency and for satisfactory reasons. Leave cannot be claimed as
right and in case of an exigency a leave application may be refused or revoked
by the authority empowered to sanction the leave.
4. Faculty member shall not leave station except with the previous permission of
proper authority, even during leave or vacation. International travel, both
personal and professional, requires a prior approval by the Director.
5. It is expected that faculty members plan their leave/travel properly and avoid any
major travel during the semester so as to minimize disruption to teaching
activities.

(Updated as per BoG approvals upto 37

th meeting held on 13 May 2023)

Background and Context:
The Board in its first meeting held on December 18, 2009 had approved the policy for
supporting excellence by faculty and students, including through faculty chairs and research
fellowships. Over the years, the Institute has been offering chairs and research fellowships
to new faculty members on a case-by-case basis using donor funds, for a period of first three
years (to be reviewed every year based on performance). These have been effective means
for recruitment of outstanding faculty to the Institute and the Institute must continue the
same. Due to limitation of funds, the Institute had not extended the chairs and research
fellowships to faculty members beyond the first three years.
The Board of Governors of the Institute in its 21st meeting held on 17 March 2017, in its 28th
meeting held on 02 January 2020, in its 29th meeting held on 20 August 2020, in its 30th meeting
held on 17 December 2020, in its 31st meeting held on 23 April 2021, in its 32nd meeting held on
20 August 2021 and in its 37th meeting held on 13 May 2023 decided to institute following named
chairs to be funded through donations.
(1) Jasubhai Memorial Chair
(2) B. S. Gelot Chair
(3) TEOCO Chair
(4) N Rama Rao Chair
(5) Jibaben Patel Chair in the area of Artificial Intelligence
(6) Jibaben Patel Chair open to all disciplines
(7) Kankuben Bakshirambhai Gelot Chair for a woman faculty
(8) Dr Dinesh O Shah Chair
(9) Smt. Meera and Prof. Girish K. Sharma Chair
(10) Dr. Vilas Mujumdar Chair
(11) Smt. Amba and Sri V. S. Sastry Chair
(12) Vikram Sarabhai Chair
(13) Pandya-Shivpuri Chair in Population Dynamics
(14) BIS Standardization Chair
Selection Criteria:
The expectations of the Institute from its faculty, as laid out in the offer letter, are divided into
four main categories: (a) teaching (b) research (c) service and (d) personal and interpersonal
skills. It is envisaged that all of these categories will form the basis for selection for the
faculty chair positions. A decent teaching record and good personal and interpersonal skills
are minimum, non-negotiable requirements to be considered. In addition, excellence in both
research and service is expected from a successful candidate for a faculty chair position.
Teaching: The successful candidate must have a decent teaching record in terms of range
of courses, class sizes, student feedback, student mentoring and guidance, etc. Currently,
there is a general level of satisfaction with teaching in the Institute and most faculty
members are doing well on this front.
Research: With its aspiration to be a top research university, the Institute expects the
successful candidate for the chair professorship to have an excellent research profile as
evidenced through publications, guidance of doctoral students and success in attracting
sponsored research funds. Further, the impact that his/her research creates (in the context
of his/her area of work) will be of greater value than numbers alone. For example, in some
cases the quality of publications and citations may be more critical, while in other cases the
impact on industry and/or society may be more valued. Further, research performed at IIT
Gandhinagar (as against research performed prior to joining IITGN or by taking leave from
IITGN) will be given higher weightage during the evaluation.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 20 (Version 6.0, June 2023) Page 2 of 2
Service to the Institute: IITGN values both service to the Institute and service to the
profession. Shared governance is one of the critical elements that determine success of top
universities around the world, and IITGN also aspires for the same. This is far more critical
for a new institute than for larger and more established institutes. In fact, the long-term
success of the IITGN will depend on how effectively the career faculty members start to take
over leadership responsibilities. Therefore, a successful candidate for the chair position is
expected to have spent time vigorously and effectively participating in Institute administration
and committees.
Personal and Interpersonal Skills: It is expected that the successful candidate will have
good personal and interpersonal skills as laid out in the expectations document.
Selection Process:
Nominations will be invited for the chair positions from the faculty, including self-nominations.
The nominated candidates will be requested to give their consent and provide a detailed
dossier on their work. A selection committee will evaluate the dossiers and make
recommendations for approval of the Chairman, Board of Governors.

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 24

th meeting held on 27 July 2018 and

25th meeting held on 03 December 2018)

The Board of Governors of the Institute in its 25th meeting held on 03 December 2018
approved the following norms for administration of sabbatical leave:
(a) A faculty member may avail six-month or one-year sabbatical (including the
duration of vacation). However, the faculty member may be granted in addition
any other leave up to a maximum of 120 days which the member might have
earned during the service at the Institute.
(b) One will be eligible for the first sabbatical, after completion of six years or more of
continuous service with the Institute as a faculty member. The period spent as a
faculty on contract, or leave from another institute or deputation may be counted.
(c) For subsequent sabbaticals:
(i) One will be eligible for a one-year sabbatical six years after returning from a
previous sabbatical.
(ii) One will be eligible for a six-month sabbatical four years after returning from
a previous sabbatical.

(d) Where the faculty member has availed of special leave or deputation for a period
of one year or more, the requirements of four years and six years in para (b) and
(c) above will be counted after his return from such special leave or deputation.
(e) The sabbatical period should be aligned with the semester system at IITGN, such
that one does not miss more than one semester of teaching in case of six-month
sabbatical, and does not miss more than two semesters of teaching in case of
one-year sabbatical. Thus, if someone avails of a sabbatical from October 1
(middle of the semester) to March 31 (middle of the next semester), it will be
treated as a “one-year sabbatical” (and not a “six-month sabbatical” even though
the person was away for only six months) for the above purposes.
(f) A faculty member may avail upto a total of three years (that is, six semesters) of
sabbatical leaves during the entire service and this may consist of a combination
of one-year (two semester) and six month (one semester) sabbaticals.
(g) During sabbatical, faculty members may be paid full salary and allowances as
admissible under normal rules. However, s/he will not be eligible for transport
allowance or any other extra allowance in India or aboard.
(h) Faculty members shall not undertake any regular appointment (in India or aboard)
during their sabbatical period. However, they will be free to receive a scholarship
or fellowship or bursary or any other „adhoc‟ honorarium other than his/her regular
employment.
(i) Faculty members availing sabbatical leave may be allowed to manage their
projects, submit reports to their sponsors, guide thesis students, etc. However,
this is subject to satisfaction of the Institute authorities that this is not likely to put
the Institute in a difficulty with respect to a sponsoring agency or with respect to
progress of the student in thesis.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 23 (Version 1.0, January 2019) Page 2 of 2
(j) Faculty members may use any funds available in their CPDA/PDA for professional
activities during the sabbatical period.
(k) If member of the Senate, the faculty members on sabbatical may choose to
participate in the Senate meetings at their discretion.
(l) Faculty members may avail other amenities in the Institute campus, such as the
health centre during the sabbatical.
(m) Faculty Members availing sabbatical leave shall furnish a bond in the prescribed
form to serve the Institute for a minimum period of three years on return to duty
after a one-year sabbatical, and a minimum period of two years on return to duty
after a six-month sabbatical.
(n) The faculty member shall be required to pay to the Institute, a sum equal to the
salary including allowances drawn by him/her from the Institute during the period
of such leave together with interest thereon at the rate in force on Government
loans, if he/she fails to serve the Institute for the period specified above in (m)
after completion of Sabbatical/ Study Leave.",
95,INCENTIVE FOR FACULTY TO SUPERVISE MORE PHD STUDENTS,Faculty Affairs Advisories,INCENTIVE FOR FACULTY TO SUPERVISE MORE PHD STUDENTS,"INCENTIVE FOR FACULTY TO SUPERVISE MORE PHD STUDENTS
(As approved by the BoG in its 25th meeting held on 03 December 2018)

Supervising PhD students is one of the essential and central roles of a faculty
member at IIT Gandhinagar. IITGN has seen a steady rise in the number and quality
of PhD students over the past few years. This aligns with the Institute’s goal of
promoting excellence in research and training the next generation of scientific
leaders.
Supervising PhD students takes a lot of time and effort, and faculty members who
supervise a large number of Ph.D. students also need more resources for supporting
travel, consumables, publication costs, and other miscellaneous costs. While some
nominal money is available through CPDA, the resources available to a faculty member
for such purposes can certainly be strengthened. Further, we expect the faculty to
supervise larger number of PhD students as they grow their research programs.
Therefore, the Board of Governors of the Institute in its 25th meeting held on 03
December 2018 approved that an amount of Rs. 1 lakh be transferred to a faculty
member’s Professional Development Account (PDA) upon timely and successful
defense of his/her student’s Ph.D. dissertation. It is envisioned that this incentive will
help faculty members transition to supervise a larger number of PhD students
without sacrificing on factors important for their growth. This is also likely to indirectly
provide an impetus to faculty research.
In case a student is co-supervised by two or more faculty members, this amount may
be split between them as appropriate. The support may not be available if the
student is inordinately delayed, i.e, he/she has not submitted the Ph.D thesis within
6 years of enrolment. The support may also be calibrated in case substantial
modifications to the thesis are required based on reviewers’ comments or a subpar
Ph.D defense. Such cases be decided by the Director on recommendation of Dean,
Academics.
This expense will be covered from the Excellence Funds or the R&D income, subject
to availability of funds. This will be effective from the inception of the Ph.D program
at the Institute.",

EXTERNAL PROJECTS

(As approved by the BoG in its 25th meeting held on 03 December 2018)
IITGN currently has more than 300 PhD students on roll. The Institute has been
liberal in terms of providing financial support to these students. More than 85% of
PhD students receive a fellowship from the Institute, while the rest are supported
from other sources. However, it is imperative that faculty should start supporting PhD
students on their external projects even when the Institute resources are not so
strained. This will prepare the Institute in the long run for a robust PhD programme
even when the Institute budget goes through severe constraints on this account.
The Board of Governors of the Institute in its 25th meeting held on 03 December
2018 approved that for faculty members supporting PhD students on their externally
funded projects, an amount of Rs. 60,000 per year be transferred to their
Professional Development Account (PDA) for each full year that the student is
supported on the external source. The terms & conditions of the scheme will be as
under.
 The project must have sufficient funds to cover the student for at least 1 year.
 The money will be transferred upon completion of the said year; for instance, if a
student was supported on a faculty member’s grant from July 2018 to June 2019,
the money will be transferred in July 2019.
 PhD students supported on large, institutional fellowships (e.g., Visvesvaraya
Fellowships, Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship, etc.) or industry fellowships
meant specially for PhD students (e.g., TCS fellowship, Google awards, etc.) are
not eligible.
 If a student is partially supported by the external projects and relies on the
Institute for remainder of the support, the amount to be transferred to the PDA will
be pro-rated accordingly.
 The duration of support will be till the student continues to be supported on the
external funds. If the student moves to Institute support at any time (for instance,
due to completion of the external project), this extra support will also be stopped.
Fund utilization from the PDA will be subject to usual Institute norms. This expense
will be covered from the R&D income of the Institute or Excellence Funds (IGR
Excellence Fund/ R&D Excellence Fund) and will be subject to availability of funds.
This will be effective from 01 January 2019 through 31 March 2023.",

The expectations for IITGN faculty members desiring Associate Professorship at IITGN
emphasize demonstration of research independence (through scholarly research output,
graduation or near-graduation of at least one PhD student, and external research funding),

1. High-quality research contributions
a. S/he must provide a clear demonstration of top-class research conducted at IITGN.
This may be established, for instance, through noteworthy publications (papers,
books, patents, technical reports, etc.) that do not include authors outside IITGN.
While collaborative work with non-IITGN colleagues is appreciated, such work alone
is not adequate.
b. S/he must have had continued success in securing external research funds. High
aspirations on this front, reflected via a commitment to raise research funds either
individually or collaboratively, will be more valued. In exceptional cases, if a faculty
member can demonstrate that his/her research does not require funds for
experimental or computational resources or fieldwork, this criterion may be relaxed.
c. S/he must have graduated a substantial number of PhD students (4 to 6), with more
expected in the future through a pipeline of students. This number may be lower for
some disciplines known for lower PhD student population or for some faculty
members who were directly appointed as Associate Professor.
d. There should be some evidence of his/her PhD students doing well professionally
after graduation. For instance, they may be in postdoctoral or faculty positions in
reputed academic institutions, professionally well placed, be successful
entrepreneurs, be making significant societal contributions, etc.
e. Formal and/or informal research mentorship to junior colleagues inside or outside
the Institute is generally expected.
f. Exceptional leadership in service to the Institute provided by a faculty member would
be appropriately factored in assessment of research contributions.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 27 (Version 1.0, June 2021) Page 2
2. Outstanding contributions to teaching
a. S/he must have continued to teach a wide range of courses at all levels with good
student ratings.
b. S/he should have developed new courses, and provided direction and leadership to
improve existing courses and programs.
c. S/he must also have contributed to mentoring students, and making the classroom
and non-classroom teaching more effective and enjoyable, thereby substantially
(re)shaping the teaching/learning environment in the discipline/institute.
3. Impact and recognition
The impact that a faculty member has made to make a better Society or Institute will be
an important consideration.
A. Making a better Society may be demonstrated via some of the following:
a. There is a clearly visible societal transformation through his/her professional work.
b. Technology developed by him/her has led to significant changes in industrial
processes, engineering and policy practices, technology transfer, licensing by
companies, etc.
c. The faculty member’s scholarly work has had a considerable impact on
education/learning in general. For instance, new teaching methods (e.g., MOOCs,
online courses), tools, technologies or textbooks developed by him/her are widely
adopted by others in his/her field and possibly outside it.
The faculty member’s research has had a potentially lasting impact on his/her area of
work. This may be corroborated by his/her visibility in the field, recognition by peers,
national and international awards, etc.
B. Making the Institute better may include:
a. S/he has implemented innovations that have significantly improved
teaching/learning/instruction at the Institute.
b. His/Her efforts have led to the creation of new initiatives/programmes/centres that
other institutes would wish to emulate.
c. S/he has become an inspiration or a role model for students and/or faculty.
d. S/he has made a clear, positive contribution towards enhancing the impact of the
Institute.
e. S/he has provided exemplary leadership in service to the Institute.

Faculty Affairs Advisory 27 (Version 1.0, June 2021) Page 3
In addition to the expectations mentioned above, a faculty member seeking an appointment at
the position of Professor at IIT Gandhinagar must have been a good citizen of the Institute and
must have worked collegially with other colleagues. Further, the faculty member’s conduct with
students in the classroom and outside must have been impeccable. S/he should have
enthusiastically participated in Institute activities, including service on various committees and
programs.
In summary, a full Professor at IIT Gandhinagar should have made transformative
contributions as an academic and must be someone who, through his/her work, serves as a
role model for others within and outside the Institute.",
99,FACULTY LEADERSHIP & SERVICE POLICY,Faculty Affairs Advisories,FACULTY LEADERSHIP & SERVICE POLICY,"FACULTY LEADERSHIP & SERVICE POLICY

Faculty play a critical role in shared governance at any top educational institution. The
faculty build and maintain traditions, culture, and mutual expectations in the campus
community through their everyday actions and behaviour. The Institute values faculty
contributions to institutional development. It encourages development of, and commitment
to constructive leadership by the members of its faculty. Besides helping their professional
development and personal advancement, such leadership promotes excellence in the
cause of higher education as well as inspire the generation of young students to achieve
their maximum potential and become leaders in their own right. Therefore, in addition to
research and instruction, leadership and service to the discipline, Institute, and the
profession are essential components of expectations from Faculty at IITGN and are
factored in all faculty evaluation and promotion decisions.
Service Expectations
The Institute expects faculty members to allocate 20% of their time to leadership and
service activities, and it allocates 20% weightage to this component in a faculty member’s
overall performance evaluation. The leadership and service expectation may be met
through contributions to Institute service as well as service to the community and the
profession. However, the dominant component of such service is expected at the
Institutional, discipline or community level. Some forms of external professional service
(such as contributions to policymaking or professional bodies at Institutional request,
contributing to Institutionally sponsored -- as opposed to personally driven -- outreach
efforts, etc.) may count toward Institutional service.
Faculty members are expected to identify and develop opportunities for service
contributions on their own and are encouraged to be enterprising in developing new
programmes and initiatives that contribute to Institutional development, their discipline,
profession or the campus community. In case faculty members are unable to identify
opportunities by themselves, they may seek the help of Associate Dean (Faculty Relations).
Any activity carried out by the faculty member, which contributes towards advancing their
research profile will not be counted towards service requirements. Further, professional
service contributions counted in the service category will not be factored under research
evaluation.
Faculty should demonstrate progressively greater leadership and active involvement in
service over time at the Institute. Candidates for promotion to full professor are expected to
demonstrate high levels of service and leadership in discipline or Institute programs or in
professional bodies. Membership or appointment to a particular position alone is not
evidence of service. Faculty members are expected to provide a description of the nature,
quantity and time commitment for each service as well as documentation of their specific
contributions and impact.
Evaluation of Service
The service contributions of faculty members will be evaluated based on their effectiveness
and impact and the enthusiastic recommendations from their peers to be included in

Faculty Affairs Advisory 28 (version 1.0, June 2021) Page 2
leadership/administrative/service roles. This will be considered in all evaluation and
promotion decisions. Faculty are expected to meet satisfactory service standards unless
relief from service has been sought and granted.
Relief from Service
a) Faculty members may request temporary relief from the service expectation for
transient personal or professional considerations (such as health, family, past
extensive service contributions, pressing research or professional demands, etc.).
b) Faculty members who do not wish to participate in service, may request for relief
from service in lieu of more teaching, wherever possible.
c) Faculty members who are not able to contribute effectively to service or had weak
service participation in the past may make a request for a reduced service
contribution, with a corresponding increase in teaching load. Faculty members are
expected to assess their service contributions and request for this additional
teaching load apriori.
Requests for such reliefs will be considered on a case-by-case basis and the request may
be sent to Associate Dean (Faculty Relations). If granted, such relief is for a specific and
limited duration. In absence of such an approval, all faculty are expected to satisfy the
service requirements.
Workload Relief and Support for Leadership and Service
The Institute relies upon the service contributions by its faculty to lead and run critical
academic and administrative operations. It is committed to nurturing faculty service and
leadership opportunities and providing professional and administrative development support
to faculty to advance their leadership potential. At the same time, the Institute expects all
faculty to meet high standards of research and teaching performance, including from faculty
who may be dedicating disproportionate efforts on Institutional service.
Faculty members serving in major administrative capacities may need to spend
substantially higher time than the 20% service expectation of all faculty. To ensure that the
research and professional activities of such faculty members are not compromised, the
Institute may provide teaching load relief and/or research or professional leave, travel
support, etc., to enable them to nurture and stay abreast of their professional and research
aspirations. The determination of teaching load relief, research or professional leave or
other forms of support is made on a case-by-case basis by the Director based on the
administrative workload and contributions of the faculty member.
For any clarification regarding this faculty leadership and service policy, the contact person
will be Associate Dean (Faculty Relations).",

Introduction
The Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) program is one of the central pillars of
IITGN's academic agenda. Over the years, HSS has emerged as a truly interdisciplinary
enterprise that promotes new epistemological paradigms in the Institute. The
advancement of this enterprise and the achievement of its full potential requires focused
efforts. The HSS has tremendous potential to evolve further and cohere with the other
disciplines and institutional goals. This document is meant to guide the faculty in this
process and further embed HSS into the aspirations of the Institute.
The advancement of HSS necessitates adopting cross-disciplinary interaction and
collaboration. The current composition of HSS with expertise in various domains is
very conducive to its further progress. This opportunity is to be exploited to enhance
the scholarship, impact, and social outreach of HSS in the Institute and beyond.
A primary objective of the HSS program is to provide the IITGN student the
intellectual tools to understand, analyze, and critique their social, cultural, and
political contexts of new knowledge systems and frameworks. This would ensure
their personal growth and professional impact. This is no ordinary task when the vast
majority (currently 95 percent) of IITGN students are in the engineering and science
disciplines and have little or no exposure to the humanities or social sciences
disciplines. This opens up a unique opportunity for HSS discipline to directly
contribute to students' intellectual demand across disciplines.
To ensure the comprehensive and rounded educational experience, the Institute has
implemented several program innovations. The most important of these is the
inclusion of several mandatory liberal arts courses in the academic curriculum. Nearly
a fifth of the course work of undergraduate students is in HSS. The objective of this
curricular requirement is to train students in critical thinking and analysis, social
responsibility, and in the techniques of effective communication, both oral and written.
Importantly, the incorporation of the liberal arts courses in the engineering and
sciences curricula is to instill in our students an appreciation of the complex social
forces that inform the development of solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
IITGN celebrates interdisciplinarity, and its HSS discipline is multidisciplinary and
eclectic. While HSS faculty members may be unlikely to find many colleagues in their
own specializations at IITGN, they may discover stimulating opportunities for
interdisciplinary and collaborative scholarship and teaching with other HSS faculty
and with colleagues in engineering and science that are often unavailable at
traditional university programs.
Faculty Roles and Responsibilities
Faculty performance at IITGN is assessed according to the following criteria:
teaching (30% weight), research (50% weight), and service (20%). Performance
expectations in each category are summarized below:

Faculty Affairs Advisory 29 (Version 1.0, November 2021) Page 2 of 3
Teaching: The HSS faculty are expected to be enthusiastic about developing and
teaching undergraduate courses contextualized for needs of students in the
engineering and science disciplines. They should strive to develop courses with
broad appeal and seek to make them relevant and salient to engineering students by
helping them draw curricular connections with their life situations. In their teaching
strategies, the HSS faculty are called upon to introduce inspiring courses and
pedagogical techniques to motivate the Institute's unique and diverse student body.
Innovative teaching strategies can include but are not limited to infusing course
content with creative and real-world examples, adopting experiential learning
techniques, and introducing comparative approaches that draw on connections
between the disciplines. HSS faculty are also encouraged to develop pedagogical
partnerships that cross disciplinary boundaries and that promote new ways of
thinking and learning.
The following are some of the criteria considered in the evaluation of faculty
teaching: quality of teaching (e.g., student feedback), range and type of courses
taught, innovations in pedagogical methods, number of students taught, mentoring of
students at different levels, etc.
Research: IITGN expects its HSS faculty to pursue their primary research interests
in any domain and specialization they desire and evolve as eminent scholars. The
research leading to the scholarship of national and international reputation is
imperative. IITGN also expects HSS faculty to be excited and enthusiastic about the
multidisciplinary scholarship.
Considering the faculty composition at IITGN, research collaborations with
colleagues in diverse areas provide a unique opportunity for the pursuit of
excellence. The Institute recommends that HSS faculty take advantage of the
intellectual diversity available on the campus and pursue research collaboration
opportunities with colleagues across disciplines. Engaging engineering
undergraduate students in their research is one strategy by which HSS faculty can
extend the disciplinary boundaries of their scholarship.
HSS faculty are more likely to succeed at IITGN if they are actively pursuing
research funding, either individually or in partnerships with other scholars, both
within and outside the institution. IITGN has a generous policy of providing support to
its faculty who wish to invite visiting scholars to the campus, organize conferences or
travel to academic meetings in other locations. Faculty are encouraged to take
advantage of these opportunities.
Faculty research evaluation considers scholarly publications, sponsored research
funding, student research guidance, and the success of their Ph.D. graduates.
Service: Strong and effective faculty involvement and leadership in the management
of the Institute is a defining characteristic of IITGN. All faculty members are expected
to participate in various committees and administrative roles enthusiastically and to
volunteer to take up new responsibilities when these would advance the Institute's
mission. Unlike many traditional universities, IITGN expects its faculty not to see
""service"" as a burden, but as an opportunity to build their leadership and bring a
sense of fulfillment to their work.

101,LEAVE TO FACULTY MEMBERS ON FOREIGN SERVICE TERMS,Faculty Affairs Advisories,LEAVE TO FACULTY MEMBERS ON FOREIGN SERVICE TERMS,"LEAVE TO FACULTY MEMBERS ON FOREIGN SERVICE TERMS
(As approved by the BoG in its 33rd meeting held on 15 November 2021)

Faculty members in the IIT system often take up remunerative positions at other
places within India or abroad for a limited duration, while maintaining lien at their
home Institution on foreign service terms. Such opportunities can be very valuable
for growth and development of the faculty members who will learn from diverse
organizations and bring useful experience and ideas back to the Institute.
In order to ensure consistency and transparency, the Board of Governors of the
Institute in its 33rd meeting held on 15 November 2021 approved the following norms
for the Institute for administration of leave or deputation to the academic staff on
foreign service terms.
1. A faculty member may avail a short (up to one semester) or a long (two or more
semesters) leave on foreign service terms.
2. A faculty member can accumulate one semester of leave on foreign service
terms in their Leave on Foreign Service Terms Account (LFSTA) for every two
years of service at the Institute (including periods of sabbatical leave).
3. The maximum duration for the leave on foreign service terms will be usually
equal to the leave balance in LFSTA. However, in case of important National or
International assignments, appointment as Head of prestigious Institutions in
India or abroad, etc., the duration may be same as the term of the appointment,
e.g., 3 or 5 years.
4. A maximum of 20% of career faculty in a discipline can be on leave on foreign
service terms at any point of time.
5. One will be eligible for the first short leave on foreign service terms, after
completion of three years or more of continuous service with the Institute as a
faculty member. Similarly, the minimum eligibility for the first long leave on
foreign service terms will be five years or more of continuous service with the
Institute as a faculty member. The period spent at IITGN as a faculty on
contract, or leave from another institute or deputation may be counted.
6. The period of leave on foreign service terms should be aligned with the semester
system at IIT Gandhinagar, such that one does not miss more than one semester
of teaching in case of short leave on foreign service terms and not more than four
semesters in case of a two-year leave, etc. Thus, if someone avails of a leave on
foreign service terms from October 1 (middle of the semester) to March 31
(middle of the next semester), it will be treated as a long leave of two semesters
on foreign service terms (and not a short leave on foreign service terms even
though the person was away for only six months) for the above purposes.
7. The duration of leave on foreign service terms will not be counted for the purpose
of probation confirmation (at all levels) and for consideration of pay upgrade for
Assistant Professors from Level 12 to Level 13A1, i.e., the clock will stop during
the leave on foreign service terms. However, the leave period will be counted for
estimating the experience for pay upgrade to HAG level or change of position
(e.g., from Assistant to Associate Professorship). They may be considered for
pay upgrade to the HAG level or can apply for consideration to a higher position
at the Institute while they are availing the leave on foreign service terms.
8. Depending on the nature of assignment during the leave period, faculty
members availing leave on foreign service terms may be allowed to manage

Faculty Affairs Advisory 30 (Version 1.0, December 2021) Page 2 of 2
their externally funded projects, submit reports to their sponsors, guide thesis
students, etc. However, this is at discretion of the Institute so as to ensure that
this is not likely to put the Institute in a difficulty with respect to a sponsoring
agency or with respect to progress of the students in thesis. Prior arrangements
must be made for teaching/student guidance responsibilities and management
of sponsored projects in consultation with the concerned Deans and approved
by the Director.
9. During leave on foreign service terms, faculty members will not be paid salary
and allowances by the Institute. Employer contributions to NPS will also not be
paid by the Institute during the leave period. However, faculty members are
expected to make their contribution for Group Insurance Scheme.
10. Even though the faculty member is not drawing salary from the Institute, they
will continue to be eligible for usual increments in the pay scale during the leave
period, i.e., on their return from leave, the salary will be fixed taking into
consideration increments due during the leave period.
11. Depending on the nature of assignment during the leave period, faculty
members may be allowed to use funds available in their CPDA/PDA for
reasonable professional activities during the period of leave. This will however
be at discretion of the Institute and not a right of the faculty member. The
Institute will not add funds to the CPDA for the period of the leave.
12. Faculty members holding Chair positions may continue to occupy the Chair
position for leave up to three years. However, the honorarium and the
contributions made towards professional development associated with the Chair
position will not be paid during the leave period.
13. If member of the Senate, the faculty members on leave on foreign service terms
may not participate in the Senate meetings.
14. Faculty members availing short leave on foreign service terms may retain the
housing allotted to them on campus on usual payments.
15. The faculty member availing long leave may retain housing allotted to them on
campus on usual payments for up to two years if they are leaving family behind.
In case family is not staying in the campus housing, all the belongings may be
locked in one room of the apartment, the rest of the apartment may be cleared
and the key of the apartment is to be handed over to the estate office. The
Institute may use those apartments until the return of the faculty member from
the leave. The faculty member must fully vacate the housing in the campus
beyond the two years.
16. They may retain the allotted office at the Institute when on short leaves and for
two years in case of long leave on foreign service terms. The office needs to be
vacated beyond two years.
17. Faculty and dependent family members will not be eligible for medical benefits
(including any reimbursements) from the Institute during the leave period.
However, as a courtesy, the Institute may allow them to avail minimal OPD
services at the Institute medical centre. The faculty members and dependent
family members may also avail other social amenities in the Institute campus,
such as sports facilities, etc., during the leave period.
18. All the above-mentioned norms will be also applicable in the case of deputation
on foreign service terms.
19. The Standing Committee on Faculty Affairs will be authorized to waive any of
the above conditions in exceptional cases in connection with leave or
deputation on foreign service terms. Such waivers should be recorded in the
minutes of the Standing Committee and reported to the Board.",
102,ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE PROGRAMME,Faculty Affairs Advisories,ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE PROGRAMME,"(As approved by the BOG in its 33rd meeting held on 15 November 2021)

IIT Gandhinagar’s curricular and co-curricular programs promote liberalism,
inclusivity, interdisciplinarity, and creativity. As part of that effort, the Institute strives
to offer its students opportunities for creative and artistic expression. The Board of
Governors of the Institute in its 33rd meeting held on 15 November 2021 approved to
create an Artist-in-Residence programme, which intends to bring Artists to the
Institute campus to engage with its students and the larger community.
The Artist-in-Residence programme is envisioned to host individuals passionately
involved in artistic expression (e.g., sculpture, painting, film, theatre, music, etc.) to

engage in creation, collaboration, and dialogue with the IITGN community. An Artist-
in-Residence would ideally undertake or/and guide projects with community

members in their domains of expertise. The programme enables artists to be
embedded within the institution's unique culture and provides opportunities for
interdisciplinary community engagement. The programme also aims to facilitate
dialogue, exchange of experiences and skills across disciplinary boundaries. It also
allows artists to work and develop innovative projects to promote a vibrant
community of artists and art enthusiasts on campus.
The Artist-in-Residence is expected to spend a minimum of four weeks at the
Institute. Artists from India or abroad, hosted under this scheme, may utilize the
period in residence to:
● Create artistic expressions
● Collaborate with IITGN Community members to co-create artistic expressions
● Nurture the artistic talent of IITGN Community members
● Conduct workshops, activities and events to promote Art initiatives at the Institute
● Offer courses to students
Artist-in-Residence will be provided with:
● To and fro air fare by economy class as per Institutional norms
● Access to IITGN Facilities and Studio spaces
● Rent free accommodation
● OPD facilities in the medical centre at par with those available to faculty of IITGN
● Office space and access to Library facilities
● An honorarium
Artists under this scheme will be selected by the Standing Committee on Faculty
Affairs, which will evaluate nominations and proposals based on the candidate’s
background, significance and potential impact of the visit, schedule of activities, etc.
The Standing Committee on Faculty Affairs may decide the honorarium to be
offered, which is presently expected to range from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 40,000 per
week. The range of honorarium may be revised from time to time. The Standing
Committee may also, in exceptional cases, approve visits of less than four weeks.",

Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN) believes in being an involved member of
the community and a good neighbour. It believes in engaging with the community of which it
is a part. Our presence should have a positive impact not only on those who are formally
part of the Institute (its students, staff, and faculty), but also on those who surround us, and
whose lives are affected by the presence of the Institute in one way or the other.
As educators, we will like to pursue means to bridge the knowledge and communication
gaps that exist between the privileged and the underprivileged. It is a high priority for IITGN
to sensitize its students about the importance of community engagement, and to encourage
them to see the world from the eyes of those who are far less privileged. The Institute will
like its students to be aware of the fundamental and structural problems facing our country
and the communities that lie within it, so that they could become a part of the solution to
such problems.
IITGN will constantly look for ways to be engaged with and contribute to the local
community. It will do this through formal and informal initiatives, outreach activities, and
educational engagement. The Institute will support and raise funds for voluntary activities
driven primarily by students, staff, and faculty which foster social responsibility, and social
sensitivity.",

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 9th meeting held on 28th March 2013)
In the existing context as per Govt. of India norms, a regular employee of the institute may
avail of a number of loans from the institute: for house building, conveyance and the like.
Usually, such loans have a long repayment period and the interest is not compounded,
turning these into rather soft loans. Many of our staff are not eligible for these loans as
they do not fulfill the required eligibility criteria. For example, house building loan can be
granted to a permanent employee only (and not on probation), whereas Motor Car
Advance can be availed by an employee who is drawing pay in the pay band (i.e. band
pay) of Rs. 19,530/- pm or more. These restrictions make many of new staff members
ineligible for these loans. In a few cases many mid-level officers coming from outside are
in need for financial assistance to establish and settle at the new place of posting.
It is, therefore, proposed that an interest-free soft advance of Rs. 1.00 Lakh may be made
available to the new staff members joining institute in PB-I & PB-II and Rs. 2.00 Lakhs in
PB-III and PB-IV. The amount will be recovered from salary over a maximum period of 20
months, or for the remaining period of deputation/lien/probation, whichever happens to be
first. This advance is meant to help the new staff members to comfortably incur initial
establishment expenditures in setting up the house and in purchase of conveyance. A
similar scheme is in vogue at the Institute for faculty members.",

1. The short term advances to the Institute employees will be made available for the
purposes of illness, education, obligatory expenses, legal costs, purchase of

2. The maximum of advance may be restricted to 3 months’ pay (sum of BS, GP & DA).
3. Interest at the prevailing rate (on the date of sanction of advance) of public provident

4. The recovery of principal and interest should be in maximum 36 equal monthly
installments.
5. The recovery starts from that month’s salary following the month, in which the
advance is drawn by the employee.
6. The amount of advance and number of installments of recovery, should be such that
after the total deduction along with recoveries against other advances/loans/taxes
etc. the take-home money for the employee does not fall below the statutory limit of
percentage of the salary, if any.
7. A second advance under this scheme can be taken during the pendency of recovery
of the previous advance under identical conditions, till the condition under (vi) is not
violated.
8. No applicant has any right to claim this short-term advance. The sanctioning
authority, after due consideration of borrowing habits and repaying capacity of the
applicant, may approve the advance at his discretion.",
115,SAFETY OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS,General Administration Advisories,SAFETY OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS,"SAFETY OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

Background:
1. There is a wide-spread concern about lack of safety awareness and culture in India,
and far too many deaths and injuries take place in India that can be easily avoided.
2. Construction work by its very nature is prone to accidents and it should be the
endeavour of everyone to ensure that all workers at the site follow strict safety norms
for their own safety and that of their co-workers. However, this is not often the case,
resulting in a number of avoidable accidents at our construction sites.
3. Accidents in an academic campus pose additional challenges. The community of
students and faculty tend to be very sensitive and accident(s) at construction site of
an academic institute can have disproportionate consequences in terms of internal
dynamics of the institute and on the construction activity.
4. IITGN greatly values dignity for all and makes extraordinary efforts to sensitize our
students towards societal issues. Hence, the Institute must ensure that all
constructions in its own campus meet the highest safety standards. Else, we will be
seen by our own students as “preaching but not practicing”.
5. Most Central Government funded institutions such as IITGN either get their work
done through CPWD or follow the CPWD manuals and norms for the construction
works. CPWD has very specific requirements on construction safety in its contracts.
For instance, the “General Conditions of Contract” for the CPWD works contains the
CPWD Safety Code running over 5 pages. However, it is rare to find such stringent
conditions being implemented on our construction sites.
Strategy:
6. IITGN has worked with CPWD to incorporate some Special Conditions in the
contracts for the IITGN works. The following gives a general sense of such Special
Conditions:
a. The contractor must employ a Safety Manager and two Safety Supervisors,
who is responsible for developing safety programs, training, implementation
and propagating safety culture. Failure to do so will attract a specified per-day
financial penalty on the contractor.
b. A Safety Monitoring Committee has been formed consisting of
representatives of the contractor, subcontractors (if any), CPWD and IITGN
with the mandate to monitor and achieve the objectives of construction safety
continuously, progressively and through effective actions. The Committee
must meet regularly and its proceedings must be received by IITGN
administration within a week of the meeting.
c. All workers must undergo safety training (to be imparted by the Safety
Manager of the contractor) for two to three days before they can be allowed to
enter into the construction areas. Thereafter, a regular schedule of refresher
workshops on safety will be maintained by the Safety Manager.
d. Any workers found within the construction site without safety gadgets (as per
occupation) shall have to pay a fine (say Rs 100 to Rs 200) per count of

The Institute has a strong sense of commitment to the well being and growth of its
community members, employees as well as those who may not be employees of the
Institute but are essential to the effective functioning of the Institute. While the Institute’s
regular employees have access to a number of government-specified benefits, its contract
employees as well as those who work for the contractors supporting our functioning do not
receive such benefits.
Being an academic institution, we are strongly committed to education at all levels. A matter
of particular concern is the education of the children of all those connected with us,
particularly those who are most vulnerable. Hence, Children’s Education Scholarships have
been set up to partially support the educational expenses of children of those members of
the IITGN community who are not our regular employees and hence are not eligible for the
usual benefits. This covers the contract and daily wage employees of the Institute, the
employees of our contractors (such as housekeeping, security, and mess), and any others
who are closely linked with the Institute in a direct manner (e.g., the canteen staff in and
around the hostels and the Institute). The effort is to define the eligibility most liberally,
rather than conservatively.
Initially, the financial support for school education (up to class 12) for the children of such
persons was up to the tune of Rs. 5,000/- per family in a year. With experience and results,
the limit has been enhanced periodically.
The current provision, as of January 2017, is of scholarship at a flat rate of Rupees 10,000/-
per year (i.e., Rupees 5,000/- half-yearly) for each eligible child (up to two children per
family) of contract employees/ workers on submission of the proof in support of continuing

some exceptions have been adopted by the Board of Governors of the Institute as covered
in different advisories. This advisory is meant to clarify the following:
1. If an employee goes out of station for official work, he/ she is treated as on duty. In
general, if TA/DA is charged to IITGN (including project account), it will be treated as
‘travel on duty’.
2. When an employee goes out for a meeting where another organization pays for the
travel, in that case the employee should seek Special Casual Leave.
3. In some instances, the Institute may provide part or full TA/DA and still treat the
concerned person as on Special Casual Leave, (for instance, in case of faculty members
participating in a conference overseas).
4. No employee shall leave station without prior permission of the concerned authority,
even during leave or vacation/ holiday. When leaving the station, an employee shall
inform the address where he/ she would be available during the period of his/ her
absence from station to the Head of the Department/ Section to which he is attached, or
Director if he is himself the Head of the Department/ Section,.
5. Delegation of work and adjustment of class shall be the responsibility of the employee

should be within a reasonable limit. Appropriate arrangement must be made by the staff/

4. The reimbursement approved in all cases will be subject to the condition that if the
employee, for whatever reason leaves the services of the Institute before completion

RECRUITMENT RULES (RR) FOR NON-FACULTY POSTS

1. INTRODUCTION:

The non-faculty staff of IIT Gandhinagar is integral to achieving the Institute’s goals of
excellence in academics and research. They perform multiple roles across various
functions/ sections and therefore have to be competent and up-to-date in their
knowledge and skills.
As per Ministry of HRD letters dated 05 July 2010 and 10 June 2013 IITs may design
non-faculty (administrative/ managerial/ technical) staff structure (within the prescribed
students to non-faculty staff ratio of 10:1.1) and to evolve recruitment rules for each
category of posts and implement them after duly getting the approval of Board of
Governors. The letters also provide for creation of a vacancy based promotions
independent of MACP. Accordingly, this document to outline Recruitment Rules (RR) of
IIT Gandhinagar has been framed.

2. SHORT TITLE AND COMMENCEMENT:

a. These rules will be called IIT Gandhinagar Recruitment Rules 2018 (RR).

b. These rules shall come into force on the date of their notification and, subsequently,
all the appointments in the Institute shall be made only in accordance with the
provisions of these rules.

c. Any person appointed on regular basis and holding the post on the date of
commencement of these rules shall be deemed to have been appointed under these
rules and shall continue in the substantive post and, the services rendered by him/
her in the said post before the said commencement shall be taken into account as
regular service for deciding eligibility for promotion to the next grade.

d. These RR are framed with long term perspective. Hence, many positions are
mentioned in RR for which recruitment/ promotion may not be exercised in the near
future.

IITGN RR

Page 2 of 53

3. OBJECTIVE:
The main objectives of Recruitment Rules are
a. Appointment of the best suitable candidate for a post by identifying appropriate
eligibility norms and following appropriate method of recruitment in line with the
requirements of the post.
b. To ensure fair process of selection in accordance with Act & Statutes of the Institute.
c. To provide a career path to employees that will encourage consistent high
performance and motivate employees to achieve excellence in their performance
and attain their career goals.
4. SANCTIONED STRENGTH AND CADERISATION:
The non-faculty posts have been classified into two categories viz., Administrative and
Technical. The posts have been organized into cadres which consist of multiple grades/
levels of employees within a work domain/ functions (e.g., The Nursing cadre consists
of Assistant Staff Nurse, Staff Nurse and Senior Staff Nurse). The RR also as far as
possible are aligned to the nomenclature, pay levels as per VII CPC scales which will be
moderated to comply with the subsequent CPC scales. The details of cadres and levels
therein are provided in Section 9 and their recruitment and promotion criteria are
detailed in Section 10. The current sanctioned posts will be mapped in these cadres and
levels. Subsequent sanctions of posts will also be mapped accordingly. The sanctioned
strength is subject to periodic review as envisaged in Section 6 below. Posts in Level 01
to 05 are categorized as Group C post, posts in Level 06 to 09 are Group B posts, and
posts in Level of 10 and above are considered Group A post.
5. METHODS OF SELECTION:
The methods of filling up of the post in each level have been prescribed for each cadre.
Two types of selection have been adopted under IITGN RR viz., (i) Open selection

through direct recruitment, and (ii) Internal selection by promotion on Merit-cum-
Seniority basis. These will be called Direct Recruitment and Promotion, respectively. In

addition, the Institute may go in for other modes of filling up posts, as provided for in the
Statutes or approved by the Board.

IITGN RR

Page 3 of 53
a. Direct Recruitment is recruitment by open advertisement which is open to all
candidates based on prescribed age, educational qualification, experience etc.
indicated in the IITGN RR. The percentage of posts in a level in each cadre to be
filled up by direct recruitment are indicated in Section 9. In addition, positions of
group A & B posts in all cadres to be filled by Direct Recruitment may also be filled
by Deputation from employees of Central, State Government or PSUs/ Autonomous
Bodies. Appointment on fixed tenure contract in regular pay scale shall also be part
of this direct recruitment process. The attributes to be evaluated for Direct
Recruitment will include (i) competence in the area, (ii) past experience,
(iii) communication skills, (iv) attitude to work, and (v) ethical values.

The procedure of Direct Recruitment normally will be as under.

repute. The official website will also carry detailed announcement of the post.

Step-II:
Applications received in response to the announcement will be scrutinized by a
Screening Committee, constituted by the Director, for eligibility. If the applications are
large in number the Screening Committee will prepare a shortlist of the applications

Step-III:
The shortlisted candidates, as approved by the Director, will be called for written test/
skill test/ personal interview to be conducted by a Selection Committee constituted by
the Director as per the provisions in the Statutes of the Institute.

appointing authority as provided in the Statutes of the Institute. Based on the approved
selection report, appointment orders will be issued to the selected candidates

have competence and potential, to a higher post through merit-cum-seniority
assessment based on written test, APAR grading and interview regarding assessing
credentials. These will be as per the prescribed qualification, number of years of
qualifying service, percentage of posts to be filled by promotion etc. The assessment
is designed to ensure that the official has sufficient opportunity to demonstrate his/her
competence/potential for holding the higher post.

Step-I:
Applications for the promotion post will be invited through an internal announcement
through email or on the official website of the Institute.

Committee will prepare a shortlist of the applications based on the shortlisting criteria
approved by the Director.

128,AWARDS FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN SPORTS,General Administration Advisories,,AWARDS FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN SPORTS,"AWARDS FOR ACHIEVEMENTS IN SPORTS
(As approved by the BoG in its 28th meeting held on 02 January 2020)

Sport is an essential component of the extracurricular activities of any educational
institute. It is also an important factor of human development, good health, and
companionship and to have a spirit of healthy and friendly competition within the
community. The Institute has been placing significant emphasis on sports activities
by students, staff and faculty.
The Inter IIT Sport Meet is an annual sports tournament organized to encourage
physical education, sporting culture and sporting spirit among the students, faculty
and staff of various IITs. Two separate events, one for the students and the other for
faculty and staff, are organized each year, normally in December. In addition, an
Inter IIT Aquatic meet is organized typically in the month of October. These meets
attract sportspersons of the highest caliber from the IIT system, and its location
rotates from one IIT to another every year.
As a second generation IIT, we have significantly smaller number of faculty, students
and staff as compared to the first generation of IITs. And yet, we will like our
contingent to the Inter IIT Sport/Aquatic Meet to win medals and awards. This can be
a huge morale booster for our internal stakeholders and help build image for the
Institute within the IIT system.
Hence, the Board of Governors of the Institute in its 28th meeting held on 20 January
2020 approved to create awards for achievements in the Inter IIT Sport/Aquatic Meet
as per the following norms:
1. The Award will be known as “Achievement in Sports Awards”.
2. Any faculty/ staff/ student who wins first, second and third prize/ medal in the
Inter IIT Sport/Aquatic Meet will be eligible for this award.
3. An amount of Rs. 50,000/- per prize/ medal with a merit certificate will be
awarded to a prizewinner in any individual sports. However, there will be an
upper ceiling of Rs 1.00 lakh per person per year, that is, if the same person
receives three medals, the cash prize will be limited to Rs 1.00 lakh only.
4. In the group sports, the award money will be Rs 1.00 lakh, which will be shared
by the members of the winning team. Merit certificate will also be given to each
member of the team.
5. The Awardees may also park the award money with the Institute and use it in
future for:
a. Professional development activities, including purchase of sporting
equipment/ facilities/ training to improve their skills.
b. Financial support (registration, travel, etc.) for participation of future
tournaments/ sports/ professional meets.
c. For team gatherings and/or celebration of their achievements.
6. The expenditure will be charged to the Excellence Funds in the endowment.
This comes into force with effect from the 2019 Inter IIT Sports and Aquatic meets."
129,GUIDELINES ON ANNUAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS FOR STAFF,General Administration Advisories,,GUIDELINES ON ANNUAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS FOR STAFF,"GUIDELINES ON ANNUAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTS FOR STAFF
Any top-class Institution must have a robust system for performance evaluation. Unlike faculty or
student evaluation, which usually includes several measurable parameters, such parameters are
limited in the case of staff performance evaluation. The evaluation of staff performance is more
subtle and depends heavily on the reporting officer to make an objective assessment of the
performance of the staff member. The Institute expects its reporting officers to exhibit highest
level of objectivity, consistency and integrity in evaluating annual performance of the staff
reporting to them. Some specific expectations in this regard are listed below:
1. The reporting/reviewing authorities should rate the staff against a large population of
his/her peers currently working in the Institute. Inconsistent staff evaluations across the
Institute, undermine the processes of staff awards and promotions.
2. Comments must be given within the framework of governance philosophy and ethos at
IITGN, and not be coloured by the experience of the reporting officer in their prior jobs.
For instance, IITGN lays great emphasis on (a) integrity and loyalty to the Institute, (b)
team work and inter-personal skills, and (c) hard work. Special attention must be given to
evaluate the staff on these parameters.
3. Undue “protectionism” of a staff at a personal or a department level is very detrimental to
the entire purpose of performance appraisal. Such “protectionism” not only vitiates the
staff assessment process but also reflects poorly on the Reporting Officer. Some
examples of such undesirable “protectionism” are:
a. This person is working under me, and hence, I must protect him.
b. I must take care of my people and reward them with outstanding/ very good
performance appraisal (so they will remain loyal to me!), regardless of the
performance.
c. If I evaluate him/ her correctly, he may lose the job or promotion (It is hard to get
a job these days!). Hence, I will personally reprimand him and try to improve him
but I must not hurt his future prospects by writing a weak appraisal.

4. Mixing of different issues must be avoided. For instance, an otherwise competent staff
may have an abrasive personality. His/ her evaluation should clearly highlight both
aspects, viz., competence on one side and abrasive personality on the other side.
5. Although formal performance appraisal is a year-end process, the Reporting Officers are
expected to review performance at regular intervals and take corrective steps by way of
oral advice/counselling, written communication, etc.
6. The Reviewing Officer should clearly express his/ her agreement or disagreement with the
remarks made by the Reporting Officer. This is particularly so with regard to adverse
remarks or with outstanding grade. He/ she may also make his/ her own remarks and
points, not mentioned by the Reporting Officer, particularly, when the report is vague and
cryptic. The Reviewing Officer is in fact expected to personally find out about the work and
conduct of the appraisee before making his/ her own judgment.
7. The entire assessment report will be reviewed by the Director (as the Accepting Authority)
before deciding the final grading for an employee. He may choose to seek additional 360-

134,Advisory on the use of the eOffice System,General Administration Advisories,,Advisory on the use of the eOffice System,"Advisory on the use of the eOffice System

1. Introduction
IIT Gandhinagar has implemented the eOffice procedure from April 20, 2023, to
fast-track the administrative procedures and to maintain records in digital format as
per the government’s vision of Digital India.
The National Informatics Center developed the portal eOffice, which many
government organizations use. This advisory highlights the key principles and tips
about using the eOffice system for IIT Gandhinagar users.
There are multiple functions and options available in the eOffice portal, not all of
them are applicable to us, and hence it is advisable to follow the guidelines given in
this document for easy work.
2. Which documents are to be initiated on the eOffice system
All paperwork other than processes already on IMS are to be initiated on the eOffice
system. These may range from simple one-page approval notes to complete
purchase files. Some common examples include:

1. PPRF and all associated purchase paperwork
2. PORF
3. Approval Notes
4. Payment Vouchers
5. Meal Order Form
6. Vehicle Requisition Form
7. Guest House Reservation Form
8. Medical Reimbursement Bills
9. etc.

All the processes already covered on IMS (such as leave applications, children
education allowance, telephone reimbursements, course registration, course
management, etc.) will continue to be processed through IMS and there are no plans
to move those to the eOffice system.
3. General principles of initiating/moving documents on the eOffice system
3.1. All documents are to be moved for approvals and recommendations as Files
3.1.1. To do this, first upload PDF or softcopy of the document as a Receipt
3.1.2. Then create a File
3.1.3. Then add the Receipt that was created to the File using the Add
Receipt button on the right panel in the File view.
3.1.4. Please review the Dos and Don’ts section to avoid various common
mistakes and pitfalls related to the above steps.
3.2. All the notings on the Green Note are official notings on the file.

_________________________________________________________________________
General Administration Advisory 28 (Version 1.0, May 2023) 1

3.3. The initiator must sign using any of the acceptable methods, the rest of the
recommender or approvers in the chain of movement of the document only
need to note their recommendation or approval in the green sheet (as long as
the document is moving within the organization).
4. How to send documents through the eOffice system

Option 1 (preferred): PDFs of filled-up forms or documents for approval is
uploaded on eOffice as a Receipt, and then this receipt is added to a File that
is created and sent as a File with a digital signature (‘esign and send’
option) on the Green Note to the next person in the chain of the approval
process. Subsequent recommendations and approvals are noted on the
Green Sheet (no need for digital signature).
Option 2: An initiator ink-signs a physical paper (filled-up form or a
document), and then a scanned version of this PDF is upload on eOffice as a
Receipt, and then this receipt is added to a File that is created and sent as a
File to the next person in the chain of the approval process (no need for
digital signature in this case). Subsequent recommendations and approvals
are noted on the Green Note (no need for digital signature).
Option 3: For simple approvals, an initiator can copy the entire document and
put it as text in Green note and then send it to the next person in the chain of
the approval process with a digital signature (‘esign and send’ option) on
the Green Note. Subsequent recommendations and approvals are noted on
the Green Note (no need for digital signature).

5. Whom to send

Documents need to be sent directly to the next recommending/approving
authority in the chain of the approval process (e.g. for procurement using
discipline funds, initiator can send the file to the discipline coordinator). The
recommending authority will send it directly to the next recommending
authority or approving authority.
In most cases, the final approving authority can return the document to the
indenter after approving it. In some cases (e.g. payment voucher), the
approving authority may send the approved document directly to the
appropriate unit that handles final processing (e.g. payment voucher sent to
accounts for processing of payment).

6. General Dos and Don’ts
6.1. Do not attach a PDF file to a File using Attach button or Attachment button,
always add PDF files using Add Receipt. Pls see the screenshot below.
6.2. Do not include anybody in “cc” while sending any kind of file.
6.3. Do not send any document as a draft or a receipt (unless it is for internal
discussion before finalization)
6.4. Do send documents as a file (not as receipt or draft).
_________________________________________________________________________
General Administration Advisory 28 (Version 1.0, May 2023) 2

6.5. Do e-sign (or ink sign and scan and upload) the filled up form or document if
you are the indenter/initiator. All others can simply mark their
recommendations or approval in green note. No need for electronic signature.
Please note that electronic signature is essential for any document that is
being sent outside the organization (like PO, invoice, or certificates, etc.), but
these will be handled by appropriate units (and the average user need not
concern themselves with this aspect).
6.6. Do send the file directly to the next recommending/approving authority
instead of sending it back to the initiator.
6.7. Click here to see the image for reference.

The Institute expects the faculty to win grants for funding their research. Office of
Dean Research and Development facilitates the faculty in seeking research funds.
However, considering that the external funding agencies may take some time to take
their decision, the Institute provides research initiation grant. This grant is mainly to
augment research facilities of the Institute. With the grant the faculty may create basic
facilities. The results thereof should help faculty win larger funding from external
agencies. Seeking external grants is a continuous process throughout the career of
the faculty members. Thus, the Institute expects the research initiation grant to
nucleate advanced research that would eventually grow into a center of excellence.
The norms of the Research Initiation Grant as approved by the Board are outlined
below.
1. The Institute will provide a fully functional office when a new faculty member joins.
This includes desktop computer, printer, data card, and a landline phone.

proposal for external funding within 60 days of joining the Institute. Faculty member
may request extension for project submission with reasons within 60 days if he/
she is unable to submit the external project in time.

A. INTRODUCTION
IIT Gandhinagar considers carrying out consultancy projects an important activity to achieve
one of its objectives in contributing to the country’s industrial growth. Hence, as a matter of
policy, the Institute encourages its faculty members to undertake consultancy work. These also
benefit the concerned faculty members and the Institute in several ways, in addition to providing
much needed service to the industry. They enrich the professional experience and knowledge of
the faculty members and thus, make them better educators. The projects provide a firsthand
knowledge of the current problems of industry, which is very helpful in tuning the curriculum to
industry’s needs. The faculty members get an opportunity to apply their ideas on practical
systems. The students working on these projects are exposed to practical experience useful in
finding better jobs towards the end of their studies. Finally, the consultancy projects provide
some financial incentive to faculty, staff and students.
Faculty members also undertake testing projects, which are required by industries/utilities for
the performance evaluation of specific products. The testing projects involve utilization of
Institute laboratory facilities. Institute, however, discourages undertaking any certification work,
unless the concerned facilities are recognized by appropriate authority for this purpose.
This document provides general guidelines for consulting and testing projects at
IIT Gandhinagar.
B. CONSULTANCY PROJECTS
B.1 Project Initiation & Management
1. Each consultancy project will have a Principal Investigator/Investigator, who will be
responsible for the following:
a. Formulating the project proposal which may include
(i) Planning of the work to be done,
(ii) Estimating costs, according to the guidelines provided in a later section, and
(iii) Identifying other collaboration partners/Investigators and consultants, if necessary.
b. Execution of work.
c. Handling all communications with the clients after the project has been accepted.
d. Submission of intermediate and final reports as agreed in the project proposal.
e. Making recommendations to the Dean, R&D regarding expenditure from the project funds
and honoraria to be paid to faculty, staff and students.
2. Appointment of Principal Investigator: Industrial organizations usually approach the Institute
for consultancy work through a faculty member or a functionary of the Institute (i.e. Head, Dean
or Director). When a faculty member is approached for the work, he/she will be the Principal
Investigator. If he/she does not wish to be the Principal Investigator or if the project is referred to
a functionary, the Principal Investigator would be identified through appropriate discussions.
3. The project proposal prepared by the Principal Investigator will be forwarded to the client
through Head of the Department and the Dean of Research and Development.

4. The Institute requires the total cost of the project to be paid by the client, in advance, before
the work commences. In case the project is to continue for more than a year, the Institute may
permit, at its discretion, commencement of work with only yearly cost deposited in advance. All
payments from clients will be received by the Institute. The expenditure and disbursements will
be made following the Institute procedures.
5. After the cost of the project has been received, the R&D Office will assign a project/job
number and inform the same to the client, Principal Investigator and the Head of the concerned
department. This completes the process of initiation of a consultancy project. The above
project/job number must be quoted in all subsequent correspondence.
6. Project file will be closed with the submission of final project report and disbursement of
all committed expenditure including honoraria, institute overheads & Goods and Services Tax
(GST).
B.2 Budgetary Norms
From the total budget of the consultancy project, the institute overhead (current rate is 20% of
the total amount) and GST will be deducted as per the applicable rates. The amount of GST
deducted, would be deposited to the Government account. The project investigator will provide
the break-up of the project amount in a prescribed proforma at the time of submitting the
proposal and also while opening the account.
Cost of a consultancy project will consist of two parts viz., Actual Expenses, and Consultancy
Fee/honoraria. The Actual Expenses should cover the following costs related to the project:
1. Permanent equipment to be procured.
2. Consumables to be used.
3. Computational charges (at commercial rates).
4. Charges to be paid for the use of specific equipment in the Institute or in central facilities.
5. Contingency expenses to cover cost of supplies, preparation of report, typing, drafting,
stationery, reproduction, literature (books, journals, membership fee of professional societies),
postage and telephone (including rental and STD/trunk call bill of telephone at residence) and
other miscellaneous expenses.
6. TA/DA to cover site visits, meetings outside the Institute and participation in conferences
within India or abroad. The most expeditious and convenient mode of travel should be used to
minimize period of absence from the Institute. There will be no restriction, from the Institute, on
travel by air or taxi on grounds of entitlement. DA will be paid as per Institute rules. Actual
lodging expenses, in addition to full DA, will be paid on production of receipt, as per the
institute, R&D office norms. For each site visit, a fee will be charged at a rate specified in the
project proposal. The site visit will be treated as a consultancy assignment, and any income from
such assignments will be distributed as per the existing norms for the consultancy projects.
Faculty members going out of town on consultancy work will be treated to be on duty subject to
a maximum of 30 days in a year.
Principal Investigator and other Investigators will be permitted to use project funds (of one or
several projects) for participation in conference/workshops/seminars within India and one
conference/workshop/seminar outside India in a year. Normal Institute rules will be applicable
for payment of TA/DA for such participations.
7. Salaries of project employees.

Research & Development Advisory 02 (Version 2.1, October 2023)
)

Page 3
8. Administrative expenses for providing infrastructure for execution of project and to cover
indirect expenses. The Institute will charge overhead towards administrative expenses at the rate
of 20% of the total project cost (excluding the GST).
9. Any other cost.
Estimates for the above expenses should be carefully prepared by the Principal Investigator
keeping in mind other market rates for equipment, material and services, R&D norms for
salaries, commercial rates for computer usage, etc.
There is no rigid norm for consultation fee/honorarium to be paid to faculty members. This
depends upon several factors such as importance of advice, expertise available in the country,
experience of the faculty, etc. Although the consultation fee is not related to the time spent
by the faculty member on the project, many experienced persons charge about four times their
daily salary for the equivalent of full day of work.
C. NORMS FOR TESTING JOBS
The Institute will undertake testing jobs at standard fee or at the charges estimated by the
faculty member who will supervise the testing work, alongwith the applicable rate of GST. The
testing fee charged from the client will be divided into three equal parts for Institute funds,
R&D Fund, and distribution to faculty and staff. It is, however, expected that the permissible
amount may be distributed to faculty and staff in case of non- routine testing jobs and only to
staff members for routine testing jobs.
D. GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (GST)
Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be charged as per the applicable rates on the total
budget of the consultancy/testing projects.
E. LIMITATIONS
1. The time spent by faculty/staff members on consultation work should be limited, on an
average, to one day a week.
2. Absence of faculty/staff member on consultancy work from campus should be limited to
30 days in a year, which should normally not exceed 7 working days in a semester.
3. It is expected that only those consultancy projects will be accepted by the Institute,
which provide challenge befitting professional competence of the faculty members. Sufficient
caution also needs to be exercised to ensure that consultancy projects do not interfere with the
normal duties of the faculty members.",

PROGRAMME

As approved by the Director on 8

th February 2012 and ratified by the Board of Governors in its

6
th meeting held on 10th March 2012, a High Level Summer Industry Academia Interaction
Programme for faculty members has been established by IIT Gandhinagar with the following
objectives:
1. To bring to participating faculty an immediate and practical knowledge of the practices of
industry in India, thus enhancing the relevance of teaching and research at IITGN.
2. To bring some of IITGN’s substantial intellectual resources to bear on problems of
immediate importance to the cooperating industrial/ R&D organizations, and thus
contribute directly to the industrial and economic development of India.
As per the programme, a faculty member spends a period ranging from four to twelve weeks
during the summer vacation as an employee of an industrial or R&D organization, applying/
specialized knowledge and skills to contribute to the host organization. During this period, the
faculty member takes personal leave/vacation as due from the Institute, and is compensated by
the host organization. As a norm, the Institute will usually recommend a monthly remuneration
approximately equal to 10 percent of the person’s annual salary at IITGN. In addition, the host
organization will also be expected to pay for round trip transportation from Ahmedabad and
provide accommodation at their location.
The organization takes considerable risk in bringing an outsider into its set-up, especially at a
high level. The faculty member must cooperate in maintaining confidentiality of the
organization’s products and processes, even if it means not publishing or disclosing the results
of his/her own work at the organization. However, most organizations permit discussion of the
summer work to some degree at least. The work done with an organization during the summer
may serve directly as course content, or form the basis of later scientific work by the concerned
faculty members or their students at IITGN.",
140,INDUSTRY-SUPPORTED B.TECH PROJECTS,Research & Development Advisories,INDUSTRY-SUPPORTED B.TECH PROJECTS,"INDUSTRY-SUPPORTED B.TECH PROJECTS

Synopsis:
Industry-supported B.Tech projects are projects undertaken by our B.Tech students (typically as
part of final year project running over one or two semesters) for which the problem statement
and a nominal financial support comes from an industrial partner.
Industry-supported BTech projects have several advantages:
Build relationships and develop effective communications between industry and IITGN
Get to know faculty who has expertise in areas relevant to the industrial partner
Provides an avenue for trying high risk projects at a very low cost with potential for high
payoff if the project is successful
Contribute to technical education in the country by helping train industry-responsive
students
Can be a useful recruitment tool; the concerned students may be enthused with the
project enough to consider career with the industrial partner
These industry-supported BTech projects are structured as follows:
Project/problem definition comes from the industry partner, typically small projects or
problems that the industry partners are very interested in solving but do not have the
time to solve.
The industry partner is charged a nominal fee of Rs. 50,000 per project per year. This
fee helps build accountability and self-esteem of the student.
The money thus collected will be pooled. After appropriate project expenses are
subtracted, the remaining portion will be used to foster excellence by students and
faculty (roughly in equal proportions).
This fee is structured such that even if one out of 10 projects is successful, it will be a
good value for money for the industrial partner.
Industry personnel will be accessible to the students for any clarifications or advice on
the project.",

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 25th meeting held on 03 December 2018)
The Institute has been growing in its size of faculty strength and the effort is being
made to create more local ownership and enable decision making at discipline level.
To provide more autonomy to disciplines to manage their requirements and
expenditure, it is necessary that various disciplines start generating their own
resources through various means possible within the Institute norms.
For the above purpose, the Board has approved creation of ‘Discipline Promotion
Account’ with acronym as ‘DPA’ for the various disciplines in the office of Dean,
Research and Development. This account will be operated by the Discipline
Coordinator as PI and it will follow the process of approval as an R&D project. It also
includes Central Instrumentation Facility (CIF) to have DPA. The Chairman of CIF
committee will be considered equivalent to Discipline Coordinator, who will act as PI
of its DPA.
The disciplines are encouraged to contribute to this account through their various
discipline level activities, such as short-courses, workshops, conferences, consultancy
project, laboratory usage charges, etc.
The available funds can be used to promote their academic programmes, develop
and maintain laboratories, support various academic and research activities,
encourage student activities, provide travel support to students and supporting
many other such expenses. Individual disciplines can form their own strategy and
make policies, over and above the policies at the Institute level, to generate
resources and manage expenditure.
Mode of operation of Discipline Promotion Account is outlined below:
 Discipline coordinator will be the PI for this account and the purchases above
financial authority of PI will need approval of Dean, R&D.
 Discipline coordinator will maintain records of expenditure and discuss the
plans and priorities with discipline faculty from time to time.",

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 25th meeting held on 03 December 2018)
The Board in its 25th meeting held on 03 December 2018 has approved the revised
norms for overhead contribution from external projects as follows:
1. A sum equal to 12.5% of the overhead from a sponsored research project will be
credited to the PDA of the concerned faculty member. If more than one faculty
member is actively involved in a project, the amount may be distributed among
them appropriately.
2. A sum equal to 12.5% of the overhead from a sponsored research project will be
credited to the Discipline Promotion Account (DPA) of the concerned discipline. If
faculty from more than one discipline are actively engaged in the project, the
amount may be distributed to those disciplines appropriately.
3. A sum equal to 15% of the overheads from a consulting project or a continuing
education programme/ conference/ workshop will be credited to the Discipline
Promotion Account (DPA) of the concerned discipline. If faculty from more than
one discipline are actively engaged in the project, the amount may be distributed
to those disciplines appropriately.
4. In case of more than one faculty members or more than one discipline being
involved, the ratio for distribution may be decided by the concerned faculty
members with approval of Dean R&D. In case of dispute, Director may decide the
ratio on recommendation of Dean R&D.
5. The faculty members may also credit any honorarium due to them through chairs/
fellowships, consulting projects, continuing education programmes, summer
courses, etc., to their PDA or to DPA. Similarly, when laboratory facilities are
utilized for consulting projects, the facility charges may be credited to DPA.
6. Discipline Coordinators will be PI for the DPA, while the concerned faculty
members will be PI for their own PDA. Expenditure from DPA and PDA will be
made in the usual project mode with usual delegation of authority.
7. PDA and DPA can be accumulated over time, but will not earn any interest.
These norms will be applicable from 01 April 2019, that is, all overheads received by
the Institute thereafter will be subject to these norms for distribution.",
150,Advisory for Manuscript Writing Retreat,Research & Development Advisories,Advisory for Manuscript Writing Retreat,"Advisory for Manuscript Writing Retreat

The multi-dimensional academic life of faculty members poses a busy calendar to deal
with on a day to day basis. Faculty members multitask while dealing with their
commitments on multiple fronts in teaching, service, projects, outreach, networking,
etc. With several of time-sensitive items in the list, manuscript writing work may at
times take a back seat. The students, project staff and faculty members of a research
group work together on a research topic while focusing on different aspects of the work
through analysis and experiments. Research groups also keep evolving new ideas
while deep-diving into the concepts and analytics. It is equally essential to consolidate
some of those thoughts and developments in a timely manner, and also to disseminate
the findings through their scholarly articles for the benefit of the research and
professional communities. Manuscript writing requires the group to work together in a
focused manner while compiling their variety of inputs and thoughts where the faculty
member leads the process. It may be helpful to a faculty member to step away from
the daily routine for some time and have complete focus on manuscript writing.
With an objective to create quality time for writing manuscripts, a scheme for
“Manuscript Writing Retreat” has been created, where a faculty member along with a
few of research students, post-doctoral fellows, project staff and other faculty
members from the group can spend about a week together at a place other than their
regular workspace. In this scheme:
● The proposing faculty member may opt for the retreat at any place within 300
kms from the campus.
● The faculty member and all other group members will be considered to be on
duty. All group members are expected to volunteer to be part of the retreat and
there should be no pressure on them to participate in the retreat.
● The faculty member will make alternative arrangements for other Institutional
commitments during the period of the retreat. Timing of the trip should be
planned and managed in such a way that it does not affect the teaching
commitments of the faculty members and class attendance of the students
joining the trip.
● Complete duration of the retreat should be dedicated to the work related to
manuscript writing. The whole group is expected to strictly adhere to this
requirement and this retreat should not be seen as a sight-seeing opportunity.
● Reasonable costs for travel and boarding/lodging will be covered by the
Institute through R&D Funds. Any additional funds needed to cover the genuine
expenses can be taken from CPDA/PDA/projects.
Research and Development Advisory 15 (Version 1.0, August 2020) Page 1 of 2

● The faculty member and the students may also choose to stay in the Institute
Guesthouse.
The faculty members can apply for this scheme any time of the year. The application
should include the names of the research group members, estimated budget, status
of the work in reference, and a clear-cut plan for writing of manuscripts. The
applications will be reviewed by the Deans of faculty affairs office and R&D office, and
approved by the Director. After return from the retreat, faculty members are expected
to submit a report indicating the overall experience and the status of the manuscripts
which were targeted to be prepared during the visit.",

Annexure-I: Some Scenarios for Classifying Activities

1. A faculty member is approached by an industry, or vice versa, for organising a
training program involving the use of a high performance computing (HPC)
cluster. What will be the classification of this activity?
It depends on the nature of the training program. For instance, if the focus of the training
program is on how to use a HPC, it shall be classified as Type-III activity. It is
considered similar to any other instrument training program (for TEM, SEM, AFM, NMR
etc.). However, if use of HPC facilities forms a small part of a focused training program,
it shall be considered as a Type-II activity. A similar training program, which involves the
use of computer labs may be considered as Type-II activity.
2. An industry professional approaches an IITGN faculty member for conducting a
specialised course in the area of his/her area of expertise at the premises of the
industry. What will be the classification of this activity?
If a career faculty is executing a course and the activity falls in his/her domain of
expertise, then the faculty can request the activity as Type-II. On the other hand, if a
non-career faculty (Professor-of-Practice, Research Professor, etc.) conducts such an
activity, it shall be considered as Type-III. Irrespective of whether the activity is
conducted at IITGN or outside, IITGN administration must be apprised about it, due
process must be followed and the activity must be approved.
3. A consultancy project driven by the faculty requires a training workshop to be
conducted for its employees. Will this activity be a Type-II or Type-III activity?
The consultancy projects are primarily in the narrow focus area of expertise of the
faculty that drives it. Thus, in this case the activity shall be considered as Type-II
activity. As far as the honoraria is concerned, the consultancy project norms will apply.
4. A government agency, like the High Court, Green Tribunal or Department of
Transportation, approaches IITGN for designing question papers for recruitment
of their staff. Will the activity come under IITGN-X? If so, under what category?
This activity is not related to education and hence will not classify as an IITGN-X
activity.
5. An industry approaches an IITGN faculty member to conduct a training program
on Fire Safety. It turns out that faculty is also associated with the Safety Center of
the Institute. Will this activity come under Type-II or Type III?
Generally, such an activity will be classified as Type-III. It is strongly encouraged to
conduct such programs to build funding of the Centre. However, the faculty member can
submit a request to classify it as Type-II in case the activity primarily falls into their
narrow research area.
6. IITGN was running a TEQIP program under the aegis of MoE. What different types
of IITGN-X activities are possible under such funding sources to conduct training
programs for a sector and what is their classification?
There were two types of activities under the TEQIP program. (1) Courses and programs
that had a broader scope, for example, program on research methodology, faculty
induction programs etc. These activities are classified under Type-III. (2) Courses in the
narrowly focused areas, for example, thermodynamics, signal processing, VLSI design
etc. These are classified under Type-II. Similar categorization can be followed for other
such projects.

Research and Development Advisory 16 (Version 1.0, September 2022) Page 6 of 6
7. IITGN has been running a sponsored project on education through its Creative
Learning Center. As part of the project it is required to conduct separate
workshops for school children and vocational training programs. What are the
classifications of these activities?
The workshop for school children shall be classified under Type-I activity whereas the
vocational training program shall be classified as Type-III activity. The reason for this
classification is that vocational training is aligned with the vision and mission of the
Creative Learning Center.
8. Kerala Water Authority (KWA) contacted IITGN for conducting a short course on
Domestic Water Management. Will it classify as Type-II or Type-III activity?
There are multiple faculty at IITGN that work in the area of water management. The
Institute shall identify the faculty closely working in this area as the coordinator to run it
as Type-III activity.
9. An IITGN faculty, including visiting, adjunct or guest faculty, approaches the
IITGN-X coordinator for conducting a short course in his/her domain of expertise.
The faculty proposes that the course is primarily of IITGN students/scholars but
shall be open to external participants without any registration fees? Will it be
classified as Type-II or Type-III?
The programs that are mainly focused on IITGN students are not part of IITGN-X. The
faculty should approach the Short Course Coordinator, through the Academic Office, for
conducting these courses.
10. Two faculty members from different disciplines plan to organise an online
conference on Fluid Mechanics with external participants without any registration
fees. What is the classification of this activity?
It is advisable to keep a reasonable registration fee for a conference. In any case, the
activity will be considered as Type-I. In case a conference is proposed to be conducted
in offline mode without any registration fees, the proposer needs to justify from what
sources the expenses for organising this conference shall be met.
11. Design and Innovation center proposes to conduct a brainstorming session for
design practice with the professionals in this area. Under what category, the
activity shall be classified?
The brainstorming session involves external participants and serves as the platform for
sharing ideas and expertise of IITGN and hence, it shall be classified as Type-I.
12. A faculty member proposes to conduct an excursion for the students from his/her
research group to discuss the modalities of research, and methods to increase
the efficiency in work output. The faculty plans to fund the expenses of excursion
from their PDA/Consultancy project. Will this be considered as an IITGN-X
activity?
As the activity involves no external parties and thus does not qualify as an IITGN-X
activity.
13. A faculty member of HSS proposes to conduct a HSS camp with a set of seminars
or webinars for external participants. What is the classification of this activity?
It shall be classified as Type-I.",

(As approved by the BoG in its 34

th meeting held on 28 April 2022)

The Board of Governors of the Institute in its 34th meeting held on 28 April 2022
approved the IITGN Focus School at IIT Gandhinagar. This Focus School is a
concept and various such programmes will be offered with different names.
1. Background: IITGN Focus School at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)
Gandhinagar will be operated by IITGN-X. The program is mainly intended to
train students graduating from various institutes in new and emerging areas and
improve their professional preparedness. Some programs under this initiative
may also be designed specifically for working professionals and school children.
2. Eligibility:
(a) Some programs would primarily be designed for students pursuing their
undergraduate studies. Students who are in the final year of their
undergraduate degree are eligible to join such programs. These may also be
open to working professionals with an undergraduate degree.
(b) Some programs may be designed for working professionals with a focus on
knowledge enhancement in a specific area like public health engineering,
where the students may also be permitted to attend.
(c) Some programs may be designed for other student groups (including high
school students, diploma students etc.) with their own eligibility criteria and
duration as applicable to their objectives. The process of approval will remain
the same.
3. Course Structure:
A successful candidate is required to clear a minimum of 12 credits through
courses, with each course generally having 1 to 4 credits. Typically, the courses
may be covered over 10 to 12 weeks for 12 credit programs and could be spread
over a year for programs with 20 credits or more. The courses will be generally
conducted online, covering the following three broad areas:
● Foundational courses: Review of basics, which are relevant to the technology
area of the program (minimum 2 credits)
● Core courses: Content related to new technology, which are usually not part
of a regular undergraduate program (minimum 6 credits)
● Leadership Skills courses: Courses in communication, teamwork, and
initiative (1 to 4 credits)

thMeeting held on 14 March 2014 and revised in June 2019)
IITGN believes that financial constraints should not become obstacles in the academic pursuit of any
student. We have extremely liberal financial aid and scholarship programs to ensure that no student feels
disadvantaged due to their financial situation. In spite of various concurrent schemes and initiatives such
as Tuition Fee Waiver, donor scholarships etc, there are cases in which students are in need of additional
financial support. Hence, the institute provides financial support in various forms as outlined below to
deserving students for their needs towards expenditures such as tuition fee, hostel and mess fee, books,
computer, pocket expenses, medical emergencies (beyond what is covered by insurance), social and
cultural activities, internships and educational tours, etc.
The terms for interest-free loans and financial grants are as below:
1. Short-Term Loans
Short-term loans will be provided to deserving students with demonstrated needs for the

stipend, personal sources or earnings through the oCEO program. Short-term loans are to be repaid
fully by the student before their graduation and the repayment terms shall be based on discussions
with the student.
2. Long-Term Loans
Long-term loans will be provided to deserving students with demonstrated needs for the above state
purposes from Student Benevolent Fund. The students shall be provided interest-free loans with
repayment dates extending up to a maximum of 36 months from their respective dates of
graduation. The repayment can be made after graduation on EMI/Quarterly/Half-yearly basis and

159,HONOUR CODE OF THE STUDENTS,Student Affairs Advisories,HONOUR CODE OF THE STUDENTS,"HONOUR CODE OF THE STUDENTS

under all circumstances. The students affirm to uphold the highest principles of honesty and
integrity in all their endeavors and foster an atmosphere of mutual respect. The students will not
take undue advantage of another individual of the IITGN community, be personally and
academically honest and treat others with respect and courtesy and neither give nor receive
unauthorized aid explicitly, but be responsible and speak out against any unjust practice.
Violation of the Honour Code
Some of the examples of conduct that might be regarded as being in violation of the Honour
Code include:
 Unauthorized Access: Possessing, using, or exchanging improperly, acquired written or

(As approved by the Senate in its 8th meeting held on 10th September 2011)
The Institute has taken several initiatives aimed at instilling in students the right set of values, as
well as, ethical conduct and practices. The Institute aims to achieve for excellence in all facets –
including adherence to exemplary values and ethical norms.
All reported cases of academic deviance/copying, and, departure from acceptable norms of
conduct and behavior including non-academic matters shall be dealt with utmost seriousness and
in a fast track mode by Senate Student Affairs Committee (SSAC).
The cases of cheating in the examinations shall be viewed far more seriously than just an award
of FAIL grade in the concerned course. However, in dealing with academic misdemeanor, the
Instructor, at the first instance, could award FAIL grade to the concerned students, and report
more serious cases (for instance, premeditated cheating) to SSAC for further consideration and
disciplinary action. All cases of academic misdemeanor shall be provided by the Instructors in
writing to the Dean of Academic Affairs and the Dean of Student Affairs for inclusion in the
student records.
The Institute expects its Student Leadership to play a crucial role (through peer pressure) in
educating all students about the ill effects of academic and non-academic misdemeanor on their
respective futures, as well as on institutional growth, development and reputation.",

13. Following is the standard procedure to be used for medical treatment:

a) For Outpatient treatment: The Students can visit the Institute Medical Centre to avail the medical
facilities. The medicines are generally available at the Institute Medical Centre and are dispensed
free of charge. In case of non-availability of the prescribed medicines at the Medical Centre, the same
can be purchased by the students from outside and the expenses shall be reimbursed upon request.
In case of requirement of specialist consultation, the patient will be referred by the IITGN doctor to
the specialist doctor for specialist opinion/treatment. The student shall pay the specialist
fees/treatment expenses upfront and subsequently claim reimbursement as per the procedure.
Prescriptions for medicine/laboratory tests etc. need an endorsement of IITGN doctors before
purchase/tests. The expenses for such OPD treatment is also reimbursable. Make sure to show an
Institute ID card while taking the treatment from the above mentioned empanelled hospitals
to avail the discounted rates. In case of dental/eye treatment, the reimbursement is capped
to 1.75 times of the CGHS rates. Hence please seek guidance from the Student Affairs office
before seeking dental/eye treatment outside.
b) The above expenditure will not be reimbursed when the student is away from the campus (viz.
semester drop, visiting home, on leave, etc.). However, if the student is away from campus
“on duty” (viz. domestic internship, field trips etc.), reimbursement may be considered on a
case-by-case basis.
c) Procedure for claiming reimbursement of OPD expenses: The duly filled in OPD reimbursement
form, supported by relevant documents including Institute Doctor’s prescription/referral is to be
submitted by the claimant student at the Institute Medical Centre within a maximum time period of
three months of the referral/date of the prescription. Upon submission of the documents, the medical
reimbursement process generally takes upto a minimum of three weeks and the applicable amount
is credited to the claimant student’s account. The reimbursement form is available at the Institute
website, as per the details mentioned below.
(IWS (Internal Website) → Forms → Student Affairs → Medical Claim Form (OPD) ) or directly here.

d) For Inpatient Treatment: As per the MoU between the Institute and the above named empanelled
hospitals, a cashless hospitalization facility shall be provided by all the above-mentioned hospitals to
the IITGN students upon showing the institute ID card and the excess bill amount, if any, which is
not covered under the medical insurance facility, shall be initially charged by the hospital to the
Institute only and not to the hospitalized student(s), so as to facilitate timely and convenient discharge
of student(s) from the hospital on completion of treatment. However, in case of emergency, the
students can seek indoor medical emergency treatment at any other nearby hospital as well and
intimate the Institute within 24 hrs of hospitalization.
e) Procedure for settlement of student hospitalization bills: The bills generated by the empanelled
hospital against referral of IITGN medical consultants for inpatient treatment will be processed for
payment by the Student Affairs Section, IITGN. In cases where a cashless insurance facility is not
provided upfront by the hospital, the bills will be forwarded to the Insurance Company for appropriate
claim settlement. Finally, in case there is any excess amount (over and above the insurance claim
settlement), paid by IITGN to the hospital, the same shall be intimated to the respective student and
charged to him/her. The IPD Claim form is available at the Institute website, as per the details
mentioned below.

(IWS (Internal Website) → Forms → Student Affairs → Medical Claim Form (IPD) ) or directly here.
14. The norms for reimbursement for medical facilities are provided in Student Affairs Advisory No.16.

162,NORMS ON PHYSICAL EDUCATION COURSE,Student Affairs Advisories,NORMS ON PHYSICAL EDUCATION COURSE,"NORMS ON PHYSICAL EDUCATION COURSE
(As approved by the Senate in its 4th Meeting held on 2nd December 2010)
IIT Gandhinagar believes in the development of a balanced personality of its students and
actively encourages the students to participate in various sports and games, for which good
facilities are made available to the students.
To re-introduce the first year students to the culture of sports and games after the arduous JEE
preparations, during which period they hardly get time for sports, the UG curriculum at IITGN
has compulsory course on Physical Education during both the first and second semesters with
P/NP credit. The course comprises various components of a regular physical education program,
such as physical exercises, games, yoga and sports. Since 2009-10 academic year, the Institute
has been expecting the students to participate in the PE activities on all five days of the week,
and expects about 80% minimum attendance of the students.
The following mode of operations for the PE course will be followed:
1) The Institute will invest further on PE activities and organize to conduct the Physical
Education sessions on all 7 days of the week.
2) The Institute will continue to expect that students crediting PE will be engaged in sports
and games 5 days per week.
3) The students will have the option to choose any 5 days out of the 7 days for attending PE
101 / PE 102. They may of course choose to participate on more than 5 days in a week.
4) Dean (Professor in Charge) of Student Affairs will be the official course instructor for
PE101 / PE102 course and will monitor the progress of the students and award grades
with the assistance of concerned faculty member in charge of sports activities and the
sports coaches/ instructors.
5) If a student for some reason is forced to miss several sessions of PE in a week (for
instance, due to sickness), he/she may make up the attendance by participating on more
than 5 days in other weeks.
6) Pass/ No Pass grade will be awarded in the PE course on the basis of 80% attendance
requirement. The Institute will STRICTLY enforce this requirement and any student who
is reported to have participated in less than 56 sessions (80% of the 70 expected sessions;
5 sessions per week for 14 weeks in a semester) in a semester will be awarded NP grade
and will have to repeat the course ab initio in a following semester.
7) If a substantial number of the first year students are deeply involved in organizing a
major cultural or technical event (such as BLITHCHRON and AMALTHEA) and a
justifiable case is made out by the student leadership that such students must miss a
reasonable number of PE sessions in the larger interest of the Institute, the Dean of
Student Affairs may award a reasonable number of “tokens” to the concerned student
leaders prior to the event. Upon completion of the activity, the concerned student leaders

Student Affairs Advisory 08 (March 2020) Page 2
will recommend allocation of these “tokens” to the first year students in ratio of their
engagement for approval of the Dean of Student Affairs.
8) While counting attendance and awarding the grades in PE, the “tokens” will be counted
as equivalent to having attended the equal number of sessions.
9) The Institute has now been conducting a thorough physical checkup of all first year
students. In case a student is found to be suffering from a serious ailment such that he/she
is advised by the Institute doctor to avoid strenuous physical activities, the Institute may
either (a) defer the PE requirements for a later semester for that student, or (b) allow the
student to carry out an “equivalent” amount of social service under supervision of a
faculty member.",
163,NORMS/ADVISORY NOTE ON COMPREHENSIVE VIVA VOCE,Student Affairs Advisories,NORMS/ADVISORY NOTE ON COMPREHENSIVE VIVA VOCE,"NORMS/ADVISORY NOTE ON COMPREHENSIVE VIVA VOCE

Preamble
It was decided in the 3rd meeting of the Senate held on July 19, 2010 to include in the
undergraduate curricular requirements a mandatory (non-credit) Pass/No Pass component in the
form of viva voce/interview. The Senate noted that the viva voce would help assess the
effectiveness of the overall teaching–learning ambience and initiatives of the institute. Further, it
would prove to be effective in identifying students needing additional attention, and thus will be
beneficial to the students as well as the administration.
The viva voce is an endeavor to connect with our students personally, because at IITGN students
are not roll numbers. Every student is an independent individual and we value his/her likes,
dislikes, views, and concerns. The viva voce helps in knowing what individual student concerns
are and in what ways we can be of help. Additionally, it is also a means of understanding the
collective concerns of the IITGN student body, and how these may be addressed. We would like
students and faculty to think of these sessions not as Q&As, but as conversations, an occasion for
students to know the faculty and the faculty to know the students beyond the parameters of the
classrooms.
In the previous 3 rounds of the viva voce, we received extremely good feedback, which helped
the Institute to reach out to students who needed help, and also to understand the student body as
a whole. We hope both students and faculty will continue to enjoy the conversations and we will
successfully connect with each other.
The process of viva voce
Viva voce sessions are conducted once every semester, and students receive a Pass/No Pass
grade for viva voce. The viva voce entails an approximately 15 minute session with each
undergraduate student. The sessions are conducted by a panel comprising 2 faculty members,
and the institute counselor or a designated personal of the institute. One of the faculty members
is from the engineering discipline that the student is specializing in. He/she mainly focuses on
the academic interests and standing, and the career goals of the student. The other faculty
member is from outside that discipline. His/her focus is the co-curricular and the extra-curricular
activities of the student. The institute counselor discusses with the student his/her overall well
being. At the end of each session, each member of the panel completes a form documenting
his/her observations about the student.
Once the viva voce sessions are over for a semester, the institute counselor, under the guidance
of Head, Counseling, prepares three reports summarizing the findings of the viva voce. One of
the reports is shared with the student body, the other with the faculty, and the report of actionable
items is shared with the concerned people. The needs of individual students as well as student
groups determined through the viva voce are addressed by the concerned.
Dos and Don’ts for panel members
1. Being on time to conduct the sessions is essential. In case of an emergency, counseling
service must be informed and helped to indentify someone else.

Student Affairs Advisory 09 (March 2020) Page 2
2. Information obtained in the viva voce is strictly confidential. Thus being biased towards
students based on information shared in the viva demoralizes students and defeats the
very purpose of the viva voce.
3. It is best not to come across as authoritative to the students in the viva. Being
authoritative acts as a hindrance to students opening up. Further, conveying something to
students politely and empathetically proves to be far more effective than direct
expressions of disapproval.
4. It is suggested not to spend more than 15 minutes on one student. If the need of talking
more with a particular student is felt, he/she can be encouraged to meet the faculty
member/s later for longer conversations. Long conversations during a scheduled session
disrupt the entire viva voce schedule. Faculty and student availability later becomes a
major constraint in completing the process.
5. In case it is not possible to talk with all the students scheduled during a particular slot, the
panel needs to be available at another mutually convenient time.
6. Viva voce works the best if the sessions are looked upon as conversations with students
and not as question- answer sessions. We need to be respectful of students as individuals,
regardless of their academic and other performance.
Ours is a residential campus and often we are the only adults with whom our students have the
opportunity to develop a bond beyond the realms of their homes. Our small gestures that make
them feel that we value them as persons and do not consider them to be just roll numbers or CPIs
often go a long way to help in this direction. Strong faculty student relationship often serves as a
safety valve to prevent young students from opting for what is never the best option.

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 15th meeting held on 02 December 2014)
IIT Gandhinagar Explorer’s Fellowship enables students to undertake travel to explore
different parts of the country and gain new prospectives. IIT Gandhinagar Explorer’s
Fellowships are intended to introduce students to cultures, people, and areas of India with
which they are not familiar. Fellows will make powerful connections and find opportunities
to foster dialogue with people from different walks of life. They will share who they are and
where they come from while learning from others about their customs and ways, who they
are, what they do, and what matters to them. Fellows will get a glimpse of many places and
many lives. The Fellows will travel fast – tasting, not savoring – in order to gain a breadth of
understanding. Their journey will spark insight, curiosity, reflection, compassion, and
commitment. This is not the usual tourist experience, instead Fellows will roam and get lost,
walk off the well-worn path, only to find themselves on unexpected adventures. They will
seek the novel, the foreign, the unknown and the uncomfortable. At times they will realize
their great strengths, other times they will be confronted with sheer humility. In six weeks
they will explore a small chunk of the world and a large chunk of themselves.
Guidelines
 Fellows must commit to travel in a group two or three members during the summer
break (May – July),
 Fellows must commit to exploring six or more states, which should include atleast one
state each from south, north and north-east regions of India.
 The fellows must commit to travel at least six weeks.
 Fellows must travel via Sleeper Class trains and state government buses and must stay
in budget accommodation, such as Dharamsalas, Homestays and Youth Hostels.
 Fellows are encouraged to organize their travel around a theme (E.g. Cuisines,
folklore, oral history, indigenous technology etc.)

(As approved by the BoG in its 21st meeting held on 17 March 2017)

Rural India remains the backbone of India’s economy and heritage. It is often represented by
“modern” urban India as backward and uneducated. It is observed that many of the students in India
are rarely exposed to rural life, economy, practices and ethos, despite call by policy makers, since
independence. IIT Gandhinagar aspires to address this concern by exposing its students to rural
India. IIT Gandhinagar Gram Fellowship aims to encourage students to immerse themselves in the
experience of what-it-is-like to live in a village. During the fellowship stay, the students would
engage with the community to understand their concerns, welfare, values and beyond. This
fellowship is expected to be a learning experience rather than a “solution” finding/seeking project to
be completed. This fellowship would help the fellows to experience the life of common people who
may not have access to sufficient resources. It would also be an opportunity for the fellows to think
beyond technological interventions to address the concerns of the community.
The students would also get a chance to understand prevailing socio, political, economic, cultural
and humanitarian factors in the community. The students should be ready to volunteer to offer social
service to the community during the fellowship. The students are encouraged to earn their livelihood
by working for the community. The fellows should stay with the members of the community and be
non-judgmental about their way of life. On their return, the fellows may translate their experiences
into possibilities of interventions which could address the concerns of the community.
Guidelines
 Fellows must commit to spend three to eight weeks during the winter (December) or summer
break (May – July) either alone or in a group of not more than three.
 The students are expected to identify the village of their engagement well in advance.
 Students are encouraged to work and earn their livelihood during their stay in the village.
Eligibility and Selection
In order to apply for IIT Gandhinagar Gram Fellowships, applicant must be regular student of IITGN
and must be at least 18 years old. It is applicable to the students of all programmes. The students of
M.Tech and Ph.D programme availing this fellowship will be granted Academic Leave to undergo
this fellowship. All complete applications will be scrutinized by the Senate Scholarships and Prize
Committee (SSPC). Shortlisted applicants will be invited for an interview by the committee to make
the final selection. The evaluation of the applications would be based on the statement of purpose
and the performance during interview, if applicable. The graduating seniors can also avail this
fellowship within two months of completing their graduation requirements.
Expenses
The fellows are expected to travel by non-AC train/bus coach (no air travel allowed). The Institute
will reimburse return fare and nominal living expenses to the students. Students are encouraged to
earn their living in the village and meet their expenses. If any fellows would like to undertake rural
development projects on their return, an amount up to Rs. 25,000/- per fellow will be available. To
avail the same, the fellows must submit a proposal to Student Affairs office and Dean, Student
Affairs would approve the project based on its merit.

167,TERMS FOR SETTING UP OF UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP(S),Student Affairs Advisories,TERMS FOR SETTING UP OF UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP(S),"TERMS FOR SETTING UP OF UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP(S)
Preamble:
Currently, the UG tuition and other fees work out to about Rs 2,50,000/- per year. In addition,
students need about Rs 50,000/- per year to cover mess, books and other expenses. Thus, the
total cost of education at IIT Gandhinagar works out to about Rs 3,00,000/- per year.
In view of the above costs, we recommend a minimum value of scholarship to be Rs 2,000 per
month for 10 months in a year, and in multiples thereof, that is, Rs 4,000 per month (Rs 40,000
per year), Rs 6,000 per month (Rs 60,000 per year), etc.
Amount:
An endowment of twenty times the annual expenditure is considered appropriate. With the
current rates of interest prevalent in the country, endowment may earn 8% - 9% interest per year.
Thus, about 5% of the endowment value will go towards paying the scholarship and the balance
of the interest earned will be added to the endowment to cover for inflation.
A UG scholarship of Rs. 2,000/- per month (for ten months in a year) would require an
endowment of Rs. 4.0 lakhs (US$ 10,000) which may be donated in one or two installments.
Donors may set-up an endowment for a scholarship of Rs. 1,000/- per month (for ten months)
and then upgrade the amount with time to make the value of scholarship @ Rs. 2,000/- per
month.
Scholarship Options:
The scholarship may be based on merit-cum-means or purely on merit.
It is preferred that the scholarship be open to all students. However,
o The donor may specify that the eligible students should come from a specific
department.
o The donor may also specify if the scholarship is meant for student(s) of a
particular year.
o The donor may wish that the scholarship is meant for a female student.

General:
The Scholarships will be named after either the donor or any other person that the donor
may decide.
IITGN will every year inform the donor about the status of the scholarship including the
name of the recipient students.
IITGN will keep separate ledger page for each such donation. The excess interest earned
(after deducting the scholarship amount) will be added to the corpus and will be used to
cover drop in interest rates, inflation, and growth.

(As approved by the Board of Governors in its 6th meeting held on 10th March 2012)
IIT Gandhinagar envisages to produce future leaders in various walks of life: engineering,
science, management, education, social work, politics and the like. For this, our students must
have the courage to take on paths different from the traditional paths taken by typical IIT
graduates upon graduation. The proposed Fellowship is meant to facilitate our fresh graduates to
spend one year in a somewhat unconventional manner to experience certain profession type in
which they may later embark upon, or to learn new skills, or just to experiment in life. For
instance:
Our students interested in taking a career with civil service may work as assistant to
senior bureaucrats (say in education, social welfare, industries, energy etc) and gain
insights in what a civil servant can or cannot do and how the government functions,
executes projects, and serves the people.
Our students passionate about education as a career may spend a year after BTech with
IIT Gandhinagar or with any other educational institute either to teach (or assist in
teaching, for instance, in conducting labs, studios and tutorials), research, in institution
building, or a combination of these. Thereafter, they may choose to go for higher studies
and make a career in education.
The students wanting to explore working in NGO sector may work as Fellow with an
NGO for a year before taking a major decision and plunging into it with long-term
commitment.
IITGN will do all it can to help provide such opportunities to its students, and will seek partners
from various sectors to host (and hence, also to fund) our students. For this, the following
common template of such Fellowships is purposed:
1. A stipend of Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000 per month plus a bachelor accommodation (similar
to a student hostel) is suggested for the Fellowship. However, in some cases, the partner
organization may agree to a higher or a lower stipend.
2. The partner organizations making a commitment for three or more years may attach their
name to the Fellowship.
3. The selected Fellow is expected to make a commitment for a fixed tenure of one year.
Thereafter, the Fellow will move on and no extension will be granted.
4. IIT Gandhinagar will facilitate and assist the Partner organizations in selection of most
suitable candidates for the Fellowships.",

st meeting held on 23 April 2021)

The Board of Governors of the Institute in its 31st meeting held on 23 April 2021
approved the following proposal for Vikram Sarabhai Research Fellowship.
IIT Gandhinagar seeks to enable all its Ph.D. students to complete their graduation in a
timely manner so that they have a competitive advantage. The aim is that most of the
Ph.D. students should complete their Ph.D. within five years and a fair number of
students should complete within four years.
All Ph.D. students who submit thesis within 48 months (4 years), will be eligible for a
12-month research fellowship at a rate higher than the Ph.D fellowship rate. This is to
encourage our students to strive to complete early, and utilize the 12 month period to
explore new areas of research, extend their Ph.D. work, publish scholarly articles and
books, and look for good career opportunities. The fellowship will be provided at the
rate of Rs 44,000/- per month (~1.25 times the rate of PhD fellowship). The fellowship
rate may be periodically enhanced whenever the Ph.D. fellowship rates are enhanced.
In some cases, the faculty may also like to provide a top-up fellowship from their own
projects/ PDA to retain the outstanding candidates. Rest of the norms be generally
similar to the norms for post-doctoral fellowships as applicable from time to time.",

support. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis and may
be in the form of interest free loan (to be repaid before or after graduation) or
